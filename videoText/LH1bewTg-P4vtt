create a positive memory such that when
 

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
create a positive memory such that when
your<00:10:45.829><c> brain</c><00:10:46.009><c> predicts</c><00:10:46.430><c> whether</c><00:10:46.670><c> you</c><00:10:46.819><c> do</c><00:10:46.940><c> that</c>

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:46.970 align:start position:0%
your brain predicts whether you do that
 

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.780 align:start position:0%
your brain predicts whether you do that
activity<00:10:47.600><c> the</c><00:10:47.630><c> next</c><00:10:47.930><c> time</c><00:10:48.139><c> it</c><00:10:48.560><c> looks</c><00:10:49.339><c> back</c><00:10:49.550><c> and</c>

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:49.790 align:start position:0%
activity the next time it looks back and
 

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
activity the next time it looks back and

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.050 align:start position:0%
thinks yeah that was it that was kind of

thinks yeah that was it that was kind of

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:46.370 align:start position:0%
of the pressure cooker and how do I

of the pressure cooker and how do I

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:48.770 align:start position:0%
manage risk two different questions I
 

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:50.050 align:start position:0%
manage risk two different questions I

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:50.060 align:start position:0%
think if I understand the second one
 

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:55.300 align:start position:0%
think if I understand the second one
properly<00:43:50.480><c> I</c><00:43:53.230><c> think</c><00:43:54.230><c> the</c><00:43:54.380><c> best</c><00:43:54.590><c> way</c><00:43:54.830><c> to</c><00:43:54.860><c> get</c><00:43:55.160><c> out</c>

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:55.310 align:start position:0%
