so that's a lot of data a lot of high
 

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.750 align:start position:0%

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
and underneath the hardware I think this
 

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:51.310 align:start position:0%
and underneath the hardware I think this

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
um you're going to get throughput
 

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.350 align:start position:0%
um you're going to get throughput
blocked<00:08:52.320><c> so</c><00:08:52.519><c> the</c><00:08:52.640><c> R1</c><00:08:53.080><c> is</c><00:08:53.279><c> a</c><00:08:53.440><c> custom</c><00:08:53.839><c> processor</c>

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
that if AR was going to happen we're not
 

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.509 align:start position:0%
that if AR was going to happen we're not
going<00:12:15.000><c> to</c><00:12:15.120><c> notice</c><00:12:15.399><c> it</c><00:12:15.839><c> because</c><00:12:16.079><c> it's</c><00:12:16.240><c> going</c><00:12:16.360><c> to</c>

00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
going to notice it because it's going to
 

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:19.750 align:start position:0%
going to notice it because it's going to

00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
something that you interact with I was
 

00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:43.110 align:start position:0%
something that you interact with I was
just<00:12:40.360><c> blown</c><00:12:40.680><c> away</c><00:12:40.920><c> at</c><00:12:41.560><c> how</c><00:12:41.920><c> simple</c><00:12:42.440><c> how</c><00:12:42.760><c> easy</c>

just blown away at how simple how easy
 

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.509 align:start position:0%
just blown away at how simple how easy
that<00:12:43.279><c> was</c><00:12:43.440><c> to</c><00:12:43.639><c> reprogram</c><00:12:44.279><c> my</c><00:12:44.440><c> brain</c><00:12:45.199><c> which</c><00:12:45.360><c> is</c>

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
that was to reprogram my brain which is
 

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:47.629 align:start position:0%
that was to reprogram my brain which is
cool<00:12:45.720><c> I</c><00:12:45.800><c> think</c><00:12:45.920><c> there's</c><00:12:46.240><c> half</c><00:12:46.920><c> I</c><00:12:47.040><c> remember</c><00:12:47.560><c> I</c>

00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:48.949 align:start position:0%
cool I think there's half I remember I
guess<00:12:47.760><c> a</c><00:12:47.920><c> question</c><00:12:48.079><c> for</c><00:12:48.240><c> you</c><00:12:48.360><c> Gary</c><00:12:48.720><c> do</c><00:12:48.800><c> you</c>

it tires the user too much and the

launched<00:16:33.720><c> there</c><00:16:33.800><c> wasn't</c><00:16:34.079><c> actually</c><00:16:34.240><c> an</c><00:16:34.399><c> app</c>

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:34.600 align:start position:0%

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.230 align:start position:0%
launched there wasn't actually an app
store<00:16:34.959><c> right</c><00:16:35.199><c> so</c><00:16:35.480><c> I</c><00:16:35.560><c> think</c><00:16:35.680><c> that</c><00:16:35.800><c> came</c><00:16:35.959><c> maybe</c><00:16:36.120><c> a</c>

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
I actually think mobile was a a fairly
 

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.949 align:start position:0%
I actually think mobile was a a fairly
big<00:17:09.520><c> component</c><00:17:09.799><c> of</c><00:17:09.959><c> coinbase</c><00:17:10.600><c> right</c><00:17:10.799><c> like</c>

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
big component of coinbase right like
 

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:12.350 align:start position:0%
big component of coinbase right like
they<00:17:11.120><c> the</c><00:17:11.199><c> fact</c><00:17:11.319><c> that</c><00:17:11.439><c> they</c><00:17:11.520><c> just</c><00:17:11.640><c> had</c><00:17:11.760><c> a</c><00:17:12.079><c> easy</c>

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
they the fact that they just had a easy
 

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.949 align:start position:0%
they the fact that they just had a easy
to<00:17:12.480><c> use</c><00:17:12.679><c> mobile</c><00:17:13.079><c> app</c><00:17:13.520><c> um</c><00:17:13.880><c> door</c><00:17:14.240><c> Dash</c><00:17:14.439><c> was</c><00:17:14.959><c> 2013</c>

00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
to use mobile app um door Dash was 2013
 

00:17:15.959 --> 00:17:17.949 align:start position:0%
to use mobile app um door Dash was 2013
and<00:17:16.039><c> so</c><00:17:16.240><c> all</c><00:17:16.360><c> of</c><00:17:16.520><c> these</c><00:17:16.720><c> things</c><00:17:17.079><c> start</c><00:17:17.400><c> and</c><00:17:17.559><c> you</c>

00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
and so all of these things start and you
 

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:19.549 align:start position:0%
and so all of these things start and you
course<00:17:18.120><c> you</c><00:17:18.199><c> had</c><00:17:18.280><c> the</c><00:17:18.360><c> rise</c><00:17:18.559><c> of</c><00:17:18.679><c> uber</c><00:17:19.039><c> not</c><00:17:19.240><c> YC</c>
