00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
not actually be so a problem and so they
 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.909 align:start position:0%
not actually be so a problem and so they
can<00:05:01.320><c> spend</c><00:05:01.520><c> a</c><00:05:01.639><c> lot</c><00:05:01.759><c> of</c><00:05:01.919><c> time</c><00:05:02.160><c> on</c><00:05:02.320><c> working</c><00:05:02.680><c> on</c>

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
these um startups and then really they
 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.710 align:start position:0%
these um startups and then really they

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.589 align:start position:0%
actually really similar to you so for me
I<00:06:58.879><c> was</c><00:06:59.039><c> a</c><00:06:59.160><c> scientist</c><00:06:59.800><c> almost</c><00:07:00.080><c> everybody</c><00:07:00.479><c> I</c>

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
to start science exchange initially um

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 align:start position:0%

have any issues that you need help with
 

00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:52.470 align:start position:0%
have any issues that you need help with
and<00:10:51.160><c> I</c><00:10:51.279><c> think</c><00:10:51.399><c> what</c><00:10:51.560><c> this</c><00:10:51.720><c> does</c><00:10:52.000><c> is</c><00:10:52.120><c> it</c><00:10:52.240><c> really</c>

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
and I think what this does is it really
 

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.949 align:start position:0%
and I think what this does is it really
creates<00:10:52.920><c> that</c><00:10:53.160><c> openness</c><00:10:53.760><c> within</c><00:10:54.000><c> the</c><00:10:54.120><c> company</c>

00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
creates that openness within the company
 

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.710 align:start position:0%
creates that openness within the company
everybody<00:10:55.480><c> everybody</c><00:10:55.880><c> knows</c><00:10:56.240><c> what</c><00:10:56.399><c> everyone</c>

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody knows what everyone
 

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.910 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody knows what everyone
else<00:10:56.920><c> is</c><00:10:57.079><c> working</c><00:10:57.399><c> on</c><00:10:58.320><c> and</c><00:10:58.519><c> which</c><00:10:58.639><c> is</c><00:10:58.760><c> really</c>

00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
else is working on and which is really
 

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.430 align:start position:0%
else is working on and which is really
important<00:10:59.399><c> for</c><00:10:59.519><c> us</c><00:10:59.720><c> because</c><00:10:59.880><c> it's</c><00:11:00.040><c> one</c><00:11:00.160><c> of</c><00:11:00.240><c> our</c>

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
important for us because it's one of our
 

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.310 align:start position:0%
important for us because it's one of our
values<00:11:01.399><c> but</c><00:11:01.639><c> also</c><00:11:02.160><c> it</c><00:11:02.440><c> creates</c><00:11:02.760><c> a</c><00:11:02.880><c> sense</c><00:11:03.079><c> of</c>

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
values but also it creates a sense of
 

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.710 align:start position:0%
values but also it creates a sense of
momentum<00:11:04.320><c> and</c><00:11:04.480><c> that's</c><00:11:04.760><c> really</c><00:11:05.040><c> important</c><00:11:05.480><c> for</c>

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
momentum and that's really important for
 

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.550 align:start position:0%
momentum and that's really important for
making<00:11:05.959><c> a</c><00:11:06.040><c> lot</c><00:11:06.160><c> of</c><00:11:06.360><c> progress</c><00:11:07.240><c> quickly</c><00:11:08.240><c> so</c><00:11:08.440><c> this</c>

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
making a lot of progress quickly so this
 

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.110 align:start position:0%
making a lot of progress quickly so this
is<00:11:08.760><c> basically</c><00:11:09.120><c> a</c><00:11:09.240><c> way</c><00:11:09.360><c> to</c><00:11:09.519><c> get</c>

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
is basically a way to get
 

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.269 align:start position:0%
is basically a way to get
done<00:11:12.120><c> I</c><00:11:12.240><c> think</c><00:11:12.680><c> um</c><00:11:13.440><c> this</c><00:11:13.839><c> is</c><00:11:14.279><c> only</c><00:11:14.839><c> you</c><00:11:14.959><c> know</c>

00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
done I think um this is only you know
 

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.389 align:start position:0%
done I think um this is only you know
obviously<00:11:15.560><c> you</c><00:11:15.639><c> don't</c><00:11:15.800><c> want</c><00:11:15.880><c> to</c><00:11:16.000><c> just</c><00:11:16.120><c> focus</c>

00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
obviously you don't want to just focus
 

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:17.670 align:start position:0%
obviously you don't want to just focus
on<00:11:16.560><c> getting</c><00:11:16.959><c> done</c><00:11:17.200><c> you</c><00:11:17.360><c> have</c><00:11:17.480><c> to</c>

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
on getting done you have to
 

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.550 align:start position:0%
on getting done you have to
actually<00:11:18.000><c> get</c><00:11:18.200><c> the</c><00:11:18.360><c> stuff</c><00:11:18.639><c> that</c><00:11:18.800><c> matters</c><00:11:19.440><c> so</c>

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
actually get the stuff that matters so
 

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.470 align:start position:0%
actually get the stuff that matters so
you<00:11:19.680><c> have</c><00:11:19.800><c> to</c><00:11:19.880><c> be</c><00:11:20.079><c> really</c><00:11:20.440><c> focused</c><00:11:21.000><c> on</c><00:11:21.240><c> what</c>

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
you have to be really focused on what
 

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.670 align:start position:0%
you have to be really focused on what
things<00:11:22.200><c> you</c><00:11:22.320><c> should</c><00:11:22.560><c> be</c><00:11:22.760><c> doing</c><00:11:23.279><c> to</c><00:11:23.480><c> really</c>

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
things you should be doing to really
 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.430 align:start position:0%
things you should be doing to really
grow<00:11:23.920><c> your</c><00:11:24.040><c> company</c>

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%

successfully<00:11:26.440><c> so</c><00:11:26.680><c> another</c><00:11:26.920><c> way</c><00:11:27.040><c> to</c><00:11:27.160><c> think</c>

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
successfully so another way to think
 

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.509 align:start position:0%
successfully so another way to think
about<00:11:27.639><c> this</c><00:11:28.240><c> is</c><00:11:28.360><c> to</c><00:11:28.519><c> do</c><00:11:28.720><c> fewer</c><00:11:29.040><c> things</c>
