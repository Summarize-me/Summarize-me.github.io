else yes uh so one question that was
submitted<00:00:30.920><c> online</c><00:00:31.359><c> was</c><00:00:31.720><c> how</c><00:00:31.840><c> do</c><00:00:31.960><c> I</c><00:00:32.160><c> identify</c>

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
submitted online was how do I identify
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.069 align:start position:0%
submitted online was how do I identify
if<00:00:32.719><c> a</c><00:00:32.840><c> market</c><00:00:33.120><c> has</c><00:00:33.239><c> a</c><00:00:33.480><c> fast</c><00:00:33.760><c> growth</c><00:00:34.120><c> rate</c><00:00:34.719><c> now</c>

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
if a market has a fast growth rate now
 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.190 align:start position:0%
if a market has a fast growth rate now
and<00:00:35.280><c> also</c><00:00:35.440><c> for</c><00:00:35.640><c> the</c><00:00:35.760><c> next</c><00:00:35.960><c> 10</c><00:00:36.200><c> years</c><00:00:36.960><c> all</c><00:00:37.079><c> right</c>

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
and also for the next 10 years all right
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.750 align:start position:0%
and also for the next 10 years all right
so<00:00:37.360><c> the</c><00:00:37.480><c> question</c><00:00:37.719><c> is</c><00:00:37.960><c> how</c><00:00:38.079><c> you</c><00:00:38.280><c> identify</c>

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
so the question is how you identify
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.990 align:start position:0%
so the question is how you identify
markets<00:00:39.079><c> that</c><00:00:39.200><c> are</c><00:00:39.320><c> growing</c><00:00:39.600><c> quickly</c><00:00:40.320><c> um</c><00:00:40.840><c> the</c>

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.269 align:start position:0%
them as a co-founder um but in any case
you<00:25:15.600><c> should</c><00:25:15.799><c> try</c><00:25:15.960><c> to</c><00:25:16.399><c> have</c><00:25:16.559><c> the</c><00:25:16.679><c> ink</c><00:25:16.880><c> dry</c><00:25:17.120><c> on</c>

00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
you should try to have the ink dry on
 

00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:19.590 align:start position:0%
you should try to have the ink dry on
this<00:25:17.679><c> before</c><00:25:18.679><c> the</c><00:25:18.799><c> company</c><00:25:19.120><c> gets</c><00:25:19.279><c> too</c><00:25:19.440><c> far</c>

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
this before the company gets too far
 

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.149 align:start position:0%
this before the company gets too far
along<00:25:20.000><c> like</c><00:25:20.120><c> certainly</c><00:25:20.440><c> in</c><00:25:20.520><c> the</c><00:25:20.640><c> first</c><00:25:20.919><c> number</c>

00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
along like certainly in the first number
 

00:25:21.159 --> 00:25:23.950 align:start position:0%
along like certainly in the first number
of<00:25:21.320><c> weeks</c><00:25:22.279><c> yes</c><00:25:22.720><c> any</c><00:25:23.000><c> experience</c><00:25:23.440><c> would</c><00:25:23.640><c> be</c>

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
of weeks yes any experience would be
 

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.950 align:start position:0%
of weeks yes any experience would be
okay<00:25:24.840><c> uh</c><00:25:25.760><c> but</c><00:25:26.120><c> then</c><00:25:26.399><c> how</c><00:25:26.520><c> do</c><00:25:26.600><c> you</c><00:25:26.760><c> know</c><00:25:27.240><c> if</c><00:25:27.440><c> it's</c>

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh but then how do you know if it's
 

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.230 align:start position:0%
okay uh but then how do you know if it's
going<00:25:28.039><c> to</c><00:25:28.159><c> be</c><00:25:28.320><c> crippling</c><00:25:28.840><c> and</c><00:25:29.000><c> you</c><00:25:29.360><c> fire</c><00:25:29.919><c> that</c>

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
going to be crippling and you fire that
 

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.870 align:start position:0%
going to be crippling and you fire that
way<00:25:31.240><c> um</c><00:25:31.480><c> so</c><00:25:31.640><c> the</c><00:25:31.760><c> question</c><00:25:32.000><c> is</c><00:25:32.480><c> I</c><00:25:32.559><c> said</c><00:25:32.760><c> that</c>

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
way um so the question is I said that
 

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.389 align:start position:0%
way um so the question is I said that
inexperience<00:25:33.600><c> is</c><00:25:33.880><c> okay</c><00:25:34.760><c> um</c><00:25:34.960><c> how</c><00:25:35.080><c> do</c><00:25:35.159><c> you</c><00:25:35.279><c> know</c>

00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
inexperience is okay um how do you know
 

00:25:35.399 --> 00:25:36.830 align:start position:0%
inexperience is okay um how do you know
if<00:25:35.559><c> that's</c><00:25:35.799><c> going</c><00:25:36.000><c> to</c><00:25:36.279><c> you</c><00:25:36.399><c> know</c><00:25:36.480><c> if</c><00:25:36.600><c> someone's</c>

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
if that's going to you know if someone's
 

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.029 align:start position:0%
