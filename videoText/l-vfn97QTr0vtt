00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:57.350 align:start position:0%
this classroom lecture tool and then we
 

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:58.690 align:start position:0%
this classroom lecture tool and then we
decided<00:08:57.740><c> we'll</c><00:08:57.980><c> just</c><00:08:58.130><c> send</c><00:08:58.220><c> it</c><00:08:58.310><c> at</c><00:08:58.400><c> all</c><00:08:58.490><c> three</c>

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:58.700 align:start position:0%
decided we'll just send it at all three
 

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
decided we'll just send it at all three
we'll<00:08:58.970><c> look</c><00:08:59.060><c> at</c><00:08:59.210><c> all</c><00:08:59.330><c> the</c><00:08:59.420><c> tools</c><00:08:59.570><c> and</c><00:08:59.690><c> we'll</c>

00:08:59.800 --> 00:08:59.810 align:start position:0%
we'll look at all the tools and we'll
 

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.210 align:start position:0%
we'll look at all the tools and we'll
just<00:08:59.900><c> pick</c><00:09:00.050><c> the</c><00:09:00.140><c> one</c><00:09:00.260><c> that</c><00:09:00.350><c> we</c><00:09:00.410><c> need</c><00:09:00.560><c> so</c><00:09:01.070><c> it'll</c>

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.220 align:start position:0%
just pick the one that we need so it'll
 

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.170 align:start position:0%
just pick the one that we need so it'll
give<00:09:01.340><c> us</c><00:09:01.430><c> a</c><00:09:01.490><c> lot</c><00:09:01.610><c> of</c><00:09:01.640><c> option</c><00:09:01.940><c> allottee</c>

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:02.180 align:start position:0%
give us a lot of option allottee
 

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.750 align:start position:0%
give us a lot of option allottee
basically<00:09:02.510><c> for</c><00:09:02.660><c> free</c><00:09:02.690><c> yep</c><00:09:03.580><c> and</c><00:09:04.580><c> then</c><00:09:04.700><c> we</c>

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
basically for free yep and then we
 

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
basically for free yep and then we
forgot<00:09:05.000><c> about</c><00:09:05.030><c> it</c><00:09:05.180><c> for</c><00:09:05.480><c> like</c><00:09:05.630><c> four</c><00:09:05.750><c> months</c>

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.050 align:start position:0%
forgot about it for like four months
 

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.660 align:start position:0%
forgot about it for like four months
so<00:09:06.680><c> months</c><00:09:06.860><c> later</c><00:09:07.010><c> we</c><00:09:07.160><c> clean</c><00:09:07.340><c> it</c><00:09:07.370><c> up</c><00:09:07.520><c> a</c><00:09:07.580><c> little</c>

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:07.670 align:start position:0%
so months later we clean it up a little
 

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
so months later we clean it up a little
bit<00:09:07.850><c> more</c><00:09:08.000><c> four</c><00:09:08.300><c> months</c><00:09:08.480><c> later</c><00:09:08.630><c> it</c><00:09:08.750><c> cleans</c><00:09:08.930><c> up</c>

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.050 align:start position:0%
bit more four months later it cleans up
 

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
bit more four months later it cleans up
a<00:09:09.080><c> little</c><00:09:09.200><c> bit</c><00:09:09.320><c> more</c><00:09:09.470><c> as</c><00:09:10.220><c> I</c><00:09:10.340><c> mentioned</c><00:09:10.610><c> now</c>

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:10.970 align:start position:0%

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.170 align:start position:0%
do is copy paste our API key so that you
 

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.570 align:start position:0%
do is copy paste our API key so that you
can<00:09:51.290><c> use</c><00:09:51.410><c> our</c><00:09:51.530><c> analytics</c><00:09:51.980><c> tool</c><00:09:52.160><c> could</c><00:09:52.460><c> you</c>

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:52.580 align:start position:0%
can use our analytics tool could you
 

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.550 align:start position:0%
can use our analytics tool could you
just<00:09:52.760><c> copy</c><00:09:52.910><c> paste</c><00:09:53.150><c> the</c><00:09:53.300><c> API</c><00:09:53.510><c> key</c><00:09:53.750><c> yeah</c><00:09:53.990><c> no</c><00:09:54.410><c> like</c>

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
just copy paste the API key yeah no like
 

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.690 align:start position:0%
just copy paste the API key yeah no like
yeah<00:09:56.320><c> so</c><00:09:57.320><c> we</c><00:09:57.650><c> started</c><00:09:57.980><c> just</c><00:09:58.250><c> feeling</c><00:09:58.550><c> like</c>

00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:58.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so we started just feeling like
 

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.940 align:start position:0%
yeah so we started just feeling like
there's<00:09:58.880><c> some</c><00:09:59.240><c> traction</c><00:09:59.510><c> on</c><00:09:59.900><c> on</c><00:10:00.470><c> this</c><00:10:00.800><c> little</c>

to you now what the rules of the road
are<00:12:13.660><c> and</c><00:12:13.810><c> what</c><00:12:13.900><c> needs</c><00:12:14.080><c> to</c><00:12:14.140><c> get</c><00:12:14.320><c> built</c><00:12:14.500><c> interest</c>

would<00:12:16.960><c> you</c><00:12:17.110><c> differentiate</c><00:12:17.620><c> that</c><00:12:18.070><c> from</c>

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:18.750 align:start position:0%
would you differentiate that from
 

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
would you differentiate that from

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
take this and use it however we want but
 

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.410 align:start position:0%
take this and use it however we want but
there's<00:12:26.560><c> a</c><00:12:26.770><c> ton</c><00:12:26.950><c> of</c><00:12:26.980><c> demand</c><00:12:27.370><c> there</c><00:12:27.580><c> would</c><00:12:28.300><c> you</c>

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:28.420 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of demand there would you
 

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.450 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of demand there would you

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:33.460 align:start position:0%
separate those two things not really I
 

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
separate those two things not really I
think<00:12:34.150><c> the</c><00:12:35.080><c> people</c><00:12:35.320><c> always</c><00:12:35.620><c> want</c><00:12:35.770><c> more</c>

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
think the people always want more
 

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
think the people always want more
features<00:12:36.250><c> yeah</c><00:12:36.700><c> but</c><00:12:37.390><c> the</c><00:12:37.510><c> the</c><00:12:37.540><c> thing</c><00:12:37.930><c> that</c>

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:38.350 align:start position:0%
features yeah but the the thing that
 

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
features yeah but the the thing that
flipped<00:12:38.980><c> was</c><00:12:39.310><c> people</c><00:12:40.210><c> would</c><00:12:40.360><c> previously</c><00:12:40.600><c> tell</c>

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:40.930 align:start position:0%
flipped was people would previously tell
 

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.050 align:start position:0%
flipped was people would previously tell
us<00:12:41.020><c> they</c><00:12:41.140><c> wanted</c><00:12:41.410><c> a</c><00:12:41.500><c> feature</c><00:12:41.680><c> but</c><00:12:42.460><c> not</c><00:12:42.640><c> use</c><00:12:42.850><c> it</c>

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:43.060 align:start position:0%
us they wanted a feature but not use it
 

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
us they wanted a feature but not use it
whereas<00:12:43.780><c> now</c><00:12:43.900><c> people</c><00:12:44.140><c> were</c><00:12:44.230><c> using</c><00:12:44.440><c> it</c><00:12:44.650><c> and</c>

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:44.770 align:start position:0%
whereas now people were using it and
 

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.830 align:start position:0%
whereas now people were using it and
they<00:12:44.860><c> would</c><00:12:44.980><c> want</c><00:12:45.160><c> a</c><00:12:45.190><c> second</c><00:12:45.520><c> feature</c><00:12:45.610><c> and</c><00:12:45.970><c> the</c>

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
they would want a second feature and the
 

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
they would want a second feature and the
it's<00:12:47.140><c> a</c><00:12:47.230><c> super</c><00:12:47.560><c> important</c><00:12:47.980><c> distinction</c><00:12:48.250><c> I</c>

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.430 align:start position:0%
it's a super important distinction I
 

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
it's a super important distinction I
think<00:12:48.580><c> a</c><00:12:48.640><c> lot</c><00:12:48.790><c> of</c><00:12:48.820><c> founders</c><00:12:49.180><c> get</c><00:12:49.360><c> caught</c><00:12:49.630><c> in</c>

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:49.870 align:start position:0%
think a lot of founders get caught in
 

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.840 align:start position:0%

converting it miss yes okay drops and
that's<00:14:36.180><c> interesting</c><00:14:36.650><c> and</c><00:14:37.650><c> then</c><00:14:37.830><c> the</c><00:14:37.920><c> third</c>

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's interesting and then the third
 

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
that's interesting and then the third

fourth and fifth ones all said exactly
the<00:14:39.780><c> same</c><00:14:39.900><c> thing</c><00:14:40.110><c> and</c><00:14:40.290><c> and</c><00:14:40.530><c> that</c><00:14:40.830><c> was</c><00:14:40.920><c> the</c>

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.010 align:start position:0%
the same thing and and that was the
 

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.350 align:start position:0%
the same thing and and that was the
point<00:14:41.160><c> at</c><00:14:41.250><c> which</c><00:14:41.339><c> I</c><00:14:41.520><c> started</c><00:14:41.880><c> becoming</c><00:14:42.120><c> a</c>

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
point at which I started becoming a
 

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.150 align:start position:0%
point at which I started becoming a
conspiracy<00:14:42.750><c> theorist</c><00:14:43.020><c> yeah</c><00:14:43.380><c> it</c><00:14:43.830><c> seemed</c><00:14:44.040><c> it</c>

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorist yeah it seemed it
 

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.740 align:start position:0%
conspiracy theorist yeah it seemed it
seemed<00:14:44.460><c> like</c><00:14:44.670><c> some</c><00:14:45.060><c> pre</c><00:14:45.360><c> meeting</c><00:14:45.630><c> had</c>

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:45.750 align:start position:0%
seemed like some pre meeting had
 

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.060 align:start position:0%
seemed like some pre meeting had
happened<00:14:46.080><c> now</c><00:14:46.560><c> but</c><00:14:46.589><c> they</c><00:14:46.770><c> were</c><00:14:46.860><c> all</c><00:14:46.950><c> doing</c>

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:47.070 align:start position:0%
happened now but they were all doing
 

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:48.829 align:start position:0%
happened now but they were all doing
exactly<00:14:47.460><c> same</c><00:14:47.610><c> thing</c><00:14:47.820><c> so</c><00:14:48.030><c> it</c><00:14:48.300><c> was</c><00:14:48.450><c> really</c>

00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
exactly same thing so it was really
 

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:52.370 align:start position:0%
exactly same thing so it was really
obvious<00:14:48.990><c> we</c><00:14:49.320><c> just</c><00:14:49.470><c> built</c><00:14:49.710><c> a</c><00:14:50.960><c> way</c><00:14:51.960><c> to</c><00:14:52.020><c> load</c><00:14:52.260><c> data</c>

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
obvious we just built a way to load data
 

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.810 align:start position:0%
obvious we just built a way to load data
directly<00:14:52.740><c> from</c><00:14:52.830><c> segments</c><00:14:53.339><c> into</c><00:14:53.490><c> a</c><00:14:53.520><c> regio</c>

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
directly from segments into a regio
 

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.329 align:start position:0%
directly from segments into a regio
fluster<00:14:54.150><c> huh</c><00:14:54.650><c> and</c><00:14:55.650><c> that</c><00:14:55.740><c> was</c><00:14:55.920><c> a</c><00:14:55.950><c> huge</c><00:14:56.190><c> thing</c>

00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
fluster huh and that was a huge thing
 

00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:58.220 align:start position:0%
fluster huh and that was a huge thing
like<00:14:56.940><c> you</c><00:14:57.120><c> you</c><00:14:57.450><c> was</c><00:14:57.600><c> really</c><00:14:57.750><c> go</c><00:14:57.930><c> out</c><00:14:58.050><c> that</c><00:14:58.170><c> it</c>

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.230 align:start position:0%
like you you was really go out that it
 

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.410 align:start position:0%
like you you was really go out that it
was<00:14:58.320><c> product</c><00:14:58.650><c> market</c><00:14:58.920><c> fit</c><00:14:58.950><c> again</c><00:14:59.339><c> yeah</c><00:15:00.089><c> it</c><00:15:00.210><c> was</c>

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
was product market fit again yeah it was
 

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.130 align:start position:0%
was product market fit again yeah it was
very<00:15:00.660><c> explosive</c>

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:01.140 align:start position:0%
very explosive
 

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.530 align:start position:0%
very explosive
so<00:15:01.440><c> we</c><00:15:01.650><c> you</c><00:15:02.339><c> know</c><00:15:02.460><c> we'd</c><00:15:02.610><c> grown</c><00:15:02.850><c> revenue</c><00:15:03.270><c> from</c>

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
so we you know we'd grown revenue from
 

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
so we you know we'd grown revenue from
zero<00:15:04.350><c> to</c><00:15:04.500><c> two</c><00:15:04.589><c> and</c><00:15:04.710><c> a</c><00:15:04.740><c> half</c><00:15:04.860><c> million</c><00:15:05.070><c> in</c><00:15:05.250><c> the</c>

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:05.370 align:start position:0%
zero to two and a half million in the
 

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.410 align:start position:0%
zero to two and a half million in the

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
first year and then we launched this red
 

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
first year and then we launched this red
shift<00:15:09.570><c> connector</c><00:15:10.080><c> and</c><00:15:10.320><c> the</c><00:15:10.920><c> next</c><00:15:11.130><c> year</c><00:15:11.250><c> one</c>

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:11.370 align:start position:0%

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
from two and a half to ten but people
 

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.190 align:start position:0%
from two and a half to ten but people
weren't<00:15:13.770><c> asking</c><00:15:14.040><c> for</c><00:15:14.820><c> that</c><00:15:14.940><c> that's</c><00:15:15.870><c> right</c><00:15:16.080><c> it</c>

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
weren't asking for that that's right it
 

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.020 align:start position:0%
weren't asking for that that's right it
was<00:15:16.260><c> one</c><00:15:16.560><c> step</c><00:15:16.800><c> too</c><00:15:17.070><c> far</c><00:15:17.100><c> for</c><00:15:17.550><c> them</c><00:15:17.610><c> to</c><00:15:17.760><c> realize</c>

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:18.030 align:start position:0%
was one step too far for them to realize
 

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.690 align:start position:0%
was one step too far for them to realize
that<00:15:18.180><c> we</c><00:15:18.300><c> could</c><00:15:18.480><c> do</c><00:15:18.810><c> it</c><00:15:18.960><c> easily</c><00:15:19.280><c> yeah</c><00:15:20.310><c> their</c>

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:20.700 align:start position:0%
that we could do it easily yeah their
 

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.460 align:start position:0%
that we could do it easily yeah their
mentality<00:15:21.000><c> I</c><00:15:21.240><c> think</c><00:15:21.300><c> was</c><00:15:21.660><c> that</c><00:15:21.690><c> oh</c><00:15:21.900><c> segment</c><00:15:22.410><c> is</c>

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:22.470 align:start position:0%
mentality I think was that oh segment is
 

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
mentality I think was that oh segment is
a<00:15:22.500><c> way</c><00:15:22.650><c> that</c><00:15:22.770><c> I</c><00:15:22.860><c> integrate</c><00:15:23.160><c> marketing</c><00:15:23.580><c> tools</c>

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:23.850 align:start position:0%
a way that I integrate marketing tools
 

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.850 align:start position:0%
a way that I integrate marketing tools
and<00:15:24.089><c> so</c><00:15:24.990><c> a</c><00:15:25.020><c> data</c><00:15:25.260><c> warehouse</c><00:15:25.560><c> is</c><00:15:25.589><c> in</c><00:15:25.830><c> a</c>

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:29.030 align:start position:0%
back she's like nope not a good idea and
I<00:22:27.360><c> read</c><00:22:27.540><c> my</c><00:22:27.630><c> own</c><00:22:27.660><c> set</c><00:22:27.930><c> of</c><00:22:27.960><c> tests</c><00:22:28.170><c> so</c><00:22:28.290><c> like</c><00:22:28.620><c> the</c>

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
I read my own set of tests so like the
 

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
I read my own set of tests so like the
the<00:22:29.700><c> hacky</c><00:22:29.940><c> ways</c><00:22:30.270><c> to</c><00:22:30.510><c> test</c><00:22:30.660><c> these</c><00:22:30.780><c> things</c><00:22:30.900><c> I</c>

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:31.050 align:start position:0%
the hacky ways to test these things I
 

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.570 align:start position:0%
the hacky ways to test these things I
think<00:22:31.110><c> are</c><00:22:31.260><c> very</c><00:22:31.440><c> valuable</c><00:22:31.620><c> in</c><00:22:31.860><c> it</c><00:22:32.010><c> and</c><00:22:32.190><c> it</c><00:22:32.280><c> it</c>

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
think are very valuable in it and it it
 

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.460 align:start position:0%
think are very valuable in it and it it
comes<00:22:33.120><c> from</c><00:22:33.240><c> having</c><00:22:33.390><c> skeptics</c><00:22:33.900><c> who</c><00:22:34.170><c> and</c>

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:34.470 align:start position:0%
comes from having skeptics who and
 

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.660 align:start position:0%
comes from having skeptics who and
different<00:22:34.770><c> perspectives</c><00:22:35.220><c> of</c><00:22:35.310><c> people</c><00:22:35.370><c> willing</c>

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:35.670 align:start position:0%
different perspectives of people willing
 

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.190 align:start position:0%
different perspectives of people willing
to<00:22:35.790><c> go</c><00:22:36.090><c> test</c><00:22:36.300><c> those</c><00:22:36.450><c> things</c><00:22:36.630><c> okay</c>

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
to go test those things okay
 

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.470 align:start position:0%
to go test those things okay
and<00:22:37.290><c> so</c><00:22:37.470><c> I</c><00:22:37.500><c> imagine</c><00:22:37.740><c> these</c><00:22:38.070><c> these</c><00:22:38.550><c> tests</c><00:22:39.210><c> from</c>

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
and so I imagine these these tests from
 

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
and so I imagine these these tests from
skeptics<00:22:40.080><c> occur</c><00:22:40.740><c> on</c><00:22:40.950><c> a</c><00:22:41.150><c> maybe</c><00:22:42.150><c> daily</c><00:22:42.600><c> but</c>

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
skeptics occur on a maybe daily but
 

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.630 align:start position:0%
skeptics occur on a maybe daily but
probably<00:22:43.290><c> like</c><00:22:43.470><c> at</c><00:22:43.620><c> least</c><00:22:43.800><c> a</c><00:22:43.920><c> monthly</c><00:22:44.190><c> basis</c>

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
probably like at least a monthly basis
 

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.070 align:start position:0%
probably like at least a monthly basis
right<00:22:44.850><c> in</c><00:22:45.060><c> terms</c><00:22:45.180><c> of</c><00:22:45.360><c> you</c><00:22:45.480><c> guys</c><00:22:45.600><c> working</c><00:22:45.870><c> on</c>

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
right in terms of you guys working on
 

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
right in terms of you guys working on
your<00:22:46.200><c> product</c><00:22:46.880><c> yeah</c><00:22:47.880><c> I'd</c><00:22:48.180><c> say</c><00:22:48.330><c> maybe</c><00:22:48.540><c> more</c><00:22:48.780><c> on</c>

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:48.810 align:start position:0%
your product yeah I'd say maybe more on
 

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
your product yeah I'd say maybe more on
like<00:22:49.020><c> a</c><00:22:49.050><c> pre</c><00:22:49.260><c> idea</c><00:22:49.530><c> basis</c><00:22:49.890><c> so</c><00:22:49.980><c> like</c><00:22:50.100><c> if</c><00:22:50.160><c> we're</c>

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:50.250 align:start position:0%
like a pre idea basis so like if we're
 

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.650 align:start position:0%
like a pre idea basis so like if we're
gonna<00:22:50.340><c> launch</c><00:22:50.580><c> a</c><00:22:50.700><c> new</c><00:22:50.790><c> product</c><00:22:51.030><c> then</c><00:22:51.390><c> it's</c>

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
gonna launch a new product then it's
 

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
gonna launch a new product then it's

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.130 align:start position:0%
really helpful to have a skeptical
 

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.770 align:start position:0%

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
might not actually be a good idea and do
 

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.300 align:start position:0%
might not actually be a good idea and do

00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:47.929 align:start position:0%
something will will make the difference
 

00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:49.750 align:start position:0%
something will will make the difference
I<00:27:48.320><c> don't</c><00:27:49.070><c> think</c><00:27:49.190><c> I</c><00:27:49.220><c> don't</c><00:27:49.400><c> think</c><00:27:49.520><c> minor</c>

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't think minor
 

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.860 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't think minor
changes<00:27:50.059><c> then</c><00:27:50.210><c> it</c><00:27:50.240><c> will</c><00:27:50.390><c> make</c><00:27:50.450><c> the</c><00:27:50.600><c> difference</c>

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:50.870 align:start position:0%
changes then it will make the difference
 

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.030 align:start position:0%
changes then it will make the difference
now<00:27:50.990><c> once</c><00:27:51.170><c> you</c><00:27:51.290><c> have</c><00:27:51.320><c> product</c><00:27:51.770><c> market</c><00:27:52.010><c> fit</c>

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
now once you have product market fit
 

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.590 align:start position:0%
now once you have product market fit
then<00:27:52.400><c> sure</c><00:27:52.640><c> you</c><00:27:52.760><c> can</c><00:27:52.880><c> optimize</c><00:27:53.059><c> the</c><00:27:53.300><c> messaging</c>

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
then sure you can optimize the messaging
 

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
then sure you can optimize the messaging
okay<00:27:54.050><c> so</c><00:27:54.440><c> then</c><00:27:54.590><c> we</c><00:27:55.400><c> should</c><00:27:55.429><c> talk</c><00:27:55.640><c> about</c><00:27:55.700><c> idea</c>

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.210 align:start position:0%
okay so then we should talk about idea
 

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
okay so then we should talk about idea
generation<00:27:56.720><c> because</c><00:27:56.960><c> that</c><00:27:57.170><c> seems</c><00:27:57.440><c> more</c>

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:57.650 align:start position:0%
generation because that seems more
 

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.110 align:start position:0%
generation because that seems more
important<00:27:58.100><c> yeah</c><00:27:58.460><c> and</c><00:27:58.610><c> these</c><00:27:58.670><c> like</c><00:27:58.910><c> minor</c>

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
important yeah and these like minor
 

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
important yeah and these like minor
deviations<00:27:59.780><c> yep</c><00:28:00.440><c> weird</c><00:28:01.250><c> where</c><00:28:01.880><c> do</c><00:28:01.970><c> you</c><00:28:02.059><c> begin</c>

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.070 align:start position:0%

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
deviations yep weird where do you begin
yeah<00:28:04.070><c> I</c><00:28:04.309><c> think</c><00:28:04.400><c> the</c><00:28:05.240><c> best</c><00:28:05.780><c> ideas</c><00:28:06.440><c> that</c><00:28:06.740><c> we've</c>

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:06.890 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the best ideas that we've
 

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.890 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the best ideas that we've
had<00:28:07.160><c> come</c><00:28:07.240><c> so</c><00:28:08.240><c> there's</c><00:28:08.600><c> a</c><00:28:08.660><c> big</c><00:28:08.780><c> difference</c>

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:08.900 align:start position:0%
had come so there's a big difference
 

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.490 align:start position:0%
had come so there's a big difference
between<00:28:09.110><c> the</c><00:28:09.380><c> first</c><00:28:09.410><c> idea</c><00:28:09.920><c> and</c><00:28:11.140><c> these</c><00:28:12.140><c> sort</c><00:28:12.440><c> of</c>

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:12.500 align:start position:0%
between the first idea and these sort of
 

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.190 align:start position:0%
between the first idea and these sort of
like<00:28:12.710><c> follow-on</c><00:28:13.190><c> ideas</c><00:28:13.880><c> and</c><00:28:14.150><c> and</c><00:28:14.960><c> the</c><00:28:15.050><c> reason</c>

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
like follow-on ideas and and the reason
 

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.930 align:start position:0%
like follow-on ideas and and the reason
so<00:28:15.710><c> the</c><00:28:15.830><c> first</c><00:28:16.040><c> idea</c><00:28:16.160><c> meaning</c><00:28:16.520><c> like</c><00:28:16.640><c> the</c><00:28:16.670><c> core</c>

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:16.940 align:start position:0%
so the first idea meaning like the core
 

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.490 align:start position:0%
so the first idea meaning like the core
product<00:28:17.300><c> that's</c><00:28:17.690><c> and</c><00:28:17.809><c> then</c><00:28:17.929><c> the</c><00:28:18.050><c> individual</c>

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:18.500 align:start position:0%

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:20.360 align:start position:0%

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:21.260 align:start position:0%
individual features you might have
 

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%

entirely new products that come along
 

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.549 align:start position:0%
entirely new products that come along

00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
but those are much easier right the the

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:30.020 align:start position:0%
problem with the first product and
 

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.660 align:start position:0%
problem with the first product and
product<00:28:30.559><c> market</c><00:28:30.890><c> fit</c><00:28:30.920><c> is</c><00:28:31.130><c> that</c><00:28:31.250><c> you</c><00:28:31.340><c> can</c><00:28:31.490><c> move</c>

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:31.670 align:start position:0%
product market fit is that you can move
 

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
product market fit is that you can move

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:33.770 align:start position:0%
the product and you can move the market
 

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.930 align:start position:0%
the product and you can move the market

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.500 align:start position:0%
in some crazy multi-dimensional space
