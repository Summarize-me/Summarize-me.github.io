00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
there was a better solution to build but
 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.629 align:start position:0%

ask them if they'd be interested in your

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
say no ask them who they try and go to
 

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.710 align:start position:0%
say no ask them who they try and go to
and<00:18:56.720><c> so</c><00:18:56.960><c> this</c><00:18:57.120><c> way</c><00:18:57.360><c> you</c><00:18:57.520><c> start</c><00:18:57.840><c> growing</c><00:18:58.480><c> the</c>

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
and so this way you start growing the
 

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.950 align:start position:0%
and so this way you start growing the

those people you immediately know
 

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
those people you immediately know
but<00:19:02.799><c> at</c><00:19:02.880><c> least</c><00:19:03.120><c> they're</c><00:19:03.280><c> still</c><00:19:03.600><c> connected</c><00:19:04.240><c> by</c>

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
but at least they're still connected by
 

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
but at least they're still connected by

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
people that you do know
 

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.590 align:start position:0%
people that you do know
so<00:19:06.240><c> they're</c><00:19:06.320><c> not</c><00:19:06.480><c> just</c><00:19:06.640><c> sort</c><00:19:06.799><c> of</c><00:19:06.880><c> completely</c>

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
so they're not just sort of completely
 

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.430 align:start position:0%
so they're not just sort of completely

the final bit of advice i'd say for
 

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.789 align:start position:0%
the final bit of advice i'd say for
where<00:19:11.440><c> to</c><00:19:11.600><c> look</c><00:19:12.000><c> is</c>

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:16.390 align:start position:0%
 
go<00:19:15.039><c> out</c><00:19:15.200><c> and</c><00:19:15.360><c> try</c><00:19:15.520><c> and</c><00:19:15.679><c> meet</c><00:19:15.840><c> people</c><00:19:16.080><c> that</c><00:19:16.240><c> just</c>

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
go out and try and meet people that just
 

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.070 align:start position:0%
go out and try and meet people that just
have<00:19:16.559><c> similar</c><00:19:16.960><c> interest</c><00:19:17.280><c> to</c><00:19:17.360><c> you</c><00:19:17.760><c> right</c><00:19:18.000><c> and</c>

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
have similar interest to you right and
 

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.510 align:start position:0%
have similar interest to you right and
so<00:19:18.240><c> this</c><00:19:18.480><c> kind</c><00:19:18.640><c> of</c><00:19:18.799><c> sounds</c><00:19:18.960><c> a</c><00:19:19.039><c> little</c><00:19:19.200><c> bit</c><00:19:19.360><c> just</c>

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
so this kind of sounds a little bit just
 

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.350 align:start position:0%
so this kind of sounds a little bit just
like<00:19:19.679><c> how</c><00:19:19.840><c> to</c><00:19:19.919><c> have</c><00:19:20.000><c> a</c><00:19:20.080><c> social</c><00:19:20.480><c> life</c><00:19:20.720><c> but</c>

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
like how to have a social life but
 

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.510 align:start position:0%
like how to have a social life but
um<00:19:21.840><c> this</c><00:19:22.080><c> is</c><00:19:22.320><c> essentially</c><00:19:22.799><c> what</c><00:19:23.200><c> finding</c>

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
um this is essentially what finding
 

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.710 align:start position:0%
um this is essentially what finding
co-founders<00:19:24.000><c> reduces</c><00:19:24.400><c> to</c>

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
co-founders reduces to
 

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.310 align:start position:0%
co-founders reduces to
so<00:19:25.280><c> if</c><00:19:25.440><c> you're</c><00:19:25.679><c> an</c><00:19:26.080><c> engineer</c><00:19:27.120><c> um</c>

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
so if you're an engineer um
 

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.669 align:start position:0%
so if you're an engineer um

uh<00:22:37.360><c> first</c><00:22:37.760><c> is</c><00:22:38.000><c> the</c><00:22:38.159><c> equity</c><00:22:38.640><c> split</c><00:22:39.360><c> right</c><00:22:39.600><c> like</c>

00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
uh first is the equity split right like
 

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:40.549 align:start position:0%
uh first is the equity split right like

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
way to think about this
 

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.149 align:start position:0%
way to think about this
is<00:22:45.280><c> your</c><00:22:45.840><c> default</c><00:22:46.480><c> equity</c><00:22:47.200><c> allocation</c>

is your default equity allocation
 

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
is your default equity allocation
should<00:22:48.320><c> really</c><00:22:48.559><c> be</c><00:22:48.720><c> 50</c><00:22:49.039><c> 50</c><00:22:49.760><c> um</c><00:22:50.320><c> that's</c><00:22:50.480><c> where</c>

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
should really be 50 50 um that's where
 

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
should really be 50 50 um that's where
you<00:22:50.720><c> want</c><00:22:50.880><c> to</c><00:22:50.960><c> start</c><00:22:51.280><c> from</c>

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
you want to start from
 

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.549 align:start position:0%
you want to start from

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
super hard on the company
 

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.750 align:start position:0%

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
so there's not really too much reason
 

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.789 align:start position:0%
so there's not really too much reason
