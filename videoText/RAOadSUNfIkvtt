carrot they go in and a character comes
out<00:16:34.420><c> I</c><00:16:34.450><c> think</c><00:16:34.780><c> we</c><00:16:35.020><c> actually</c><00:16:35.320><c> for</c><00:16:35.560><c> the</c><00:16:35.620><c> final</c>

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
out I think we actually for the final
 

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.470 align:start position:0%
out I think we actually for the final
version<00:16:36.370><c> there</c><00:16:36.490><c> the</c><00:16:36.730><c> character</c><00:16:37.030><c> never</c><00:16:37.180><c> leaves</c>

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
version there the character never leaves
 

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
version there the character never leaves
but<00:16:37.870><c> there's</c><00:16:38.050><c> a</c><00:16:38.110><c> version</c><00:16:38.290><c> where</c><00:16:38.560><c> they're</c><00:16:38.680><c> sort</c>

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:38.950 align:start position:0%
but there's a version where they're sort
 

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
but there's a version where they're sort
of<00:16:39.150><c> the</c><00:16:40.150><c> characters</c><00:16:40.780><c> go</c><00:16:40.990><c> in</c><00:16:41.140><c> whatever</c>

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:41.410 align:start position:0%
of the characters go in whatever
 

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
of the characters go in whatever
combination<00:16:41.650><c> and</c><00:16:42.100><c> the</c><00:16:42.190><c> earliest</c><00:16:42.520><c> version</c><00:16:42.880><c> and</c>

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
combination and the earliest version and
 

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
combination and the earliest version and
then<00:16:43.270><c> and</c><00:16:43.600><c> then</c><00:16:43.690><c> one</c><00:16:44.050><c> of</c><00:16:44.170><c> it</c><00:16:44.260><c> people</c><00:16:44.710><c> kind</c><00:16:44.950><c> of</c>

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.010 align:start position:0%
then and then one of it people kind of
 

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
then and then one of it people kind of
comes<00:16:45.250><c> out</c><00:16:45.490><c> and</c><00:16:45.820><c> so</c><00:16:46.510><c> so</c><00:16:46.930><c> from</c><00:16:47.020><c> the</c><00:16:47.170><c> point</c><00:16:47.350><c> of</c>

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.410 align:start position:0%
comes out and so so from the point of
 

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.329 align:start position:0%
comes out and so so from the point of

the static electricity creates life and
 

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
the static electricity creates life and

then it has a little civilization and
 

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.809 align:start position:0%
then it has a little civilization and
point<00:17:14.770><c> we're</c><00:17:14.890><c> like</c><00:17:15.010><c> they</c><00:17:15.160><c> get</c><00:17:15.339><c> to</c><00:17:15.430><c> the</c><00:17:15.520><c> future</c>

flying around and attacking Bart and it
 

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:22.350 align:start position:0%

felt like it was a little too much like

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:25.569 align:start position:0%
that and so I think also we because we
 

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.780 align:start position:0%
that and so I think also we because we
were<00:17:25.720><c> doing</c><00:17:26.050><c> the</c><00:17:26.170><c> beats</c><00:17:26.439><c> where</c><00:17:27.310><c> Rick</c><00:17:27.579><c> and</c>

throughout<00:17:31.690><c> time</c><00:17:32.290><c> period</c><00:17:32.680><c> so</c><00:17:32.800><c> they'd</c><00:17:32.950><c> get</c><00:17:33.130><c> to</c>

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%

because like I mean it's like basically
your<00:45:56.569><c> generation</c><00:45:57.049><c> that's</c><00:45:57.259><c> allowed</c><00:45:57.589><c> that</c><00:45:57.799><c> to</c>

00:45:57.819 --> 00:45:57.829 align:start position:0%
your generation that's allowed that to
 

00:45:57.829 --> 00:46:00.069 align:start position:0%
your generation that's allowed that to
happen<00:45:58.069><c> right</c><00:45:58.430><c> so</c><00:45:58.940><c> it's</c><00:45:59.269><c> like</c><00:45:59.359><c> if</c><00:45:59.539><c> you're</c><00:45:59.720><c> a</c><00:45:59.869><c> we</c>

and you really you have to just make it
for<00:46:22.759><c> an</c><00:46:22.880><c> audience</c><00:46:23.119><c> of</c><00:46:23.299><c> one</c>

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:26.589 align:start position:0%
and of course hope that that ends up
 

00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:29.069 align:start position:0%
and of course hope that that ends up
resonating<00:46:27.589><c> with</c><00:46:27.710><c> an</c><00:46:27.799><c> audience</c><00:46:28.069><c> of</c><00:46:28.220><c> millions</c>

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:48.190 align:start position:0%
execute it properly then it's a show
 

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:49.799 align:start position:0%
execute it properly then it's a show
that's<00:46:48.220><c> never</c><00:46:48.490><c> been</c><00:46:48.640><c> seen</c><00:46:48.849><c> before</c><00:46:48.970><c> and</c><00:46:49.359><c> that's</c>

00:46:51.299 --> 00:46:51.309 align:start position:0%
that could be great it could also be a
 

00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
that could be great it could also be a
total<00:46:51.700><c> failure</c><00:46:51.910><c> but</c><00:46:52.210><c> it</c><00:46:52.420><c> could</c><00:46:52.540><c> be</c><00:46:52.660><c> great</c><00:46:52.809><c> at</c>

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:52.930 align:start position:0%
total failure but it could be great at
 

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:56.609 align:start position:0%
total failure but it could be great at
least<00:46:53.230><c> it's</c><00:46:53.589><c> a</c><00:46:53.680><c> risk</c><00:46:53.920><c> that</c><00:46:54.130><c> could</c><00:46:54.250><c> pay</c><00:46:54.430><c> off</c><00:46:55.619><c> so</c>

00:46:56.609 --> 00:46:56.619 align:start position:0%
least it's a risk that could pay off so
 

00:46:56.619 --> 00:46:58.170 align:start position:0%
least it's a risk that could pay off so
yeah<00:46:56.799><c> I</c><00:46:56.829><c> think</c><00:46:57.040><c> that</c><00:46:57.339><c> that's</c><00:46:57.609><c> that's</c><00:46:57.819><c> that's</c>

00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:58.180 align:start position:0%
