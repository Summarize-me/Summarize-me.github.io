so<00:09:49.839><c> I</c><00:09:49.959><c> think</c><00:09:50.120><c> we</c><00:09:50.200><c> would</c><00:09:50.360><c> argue</c><00:09:50.880><c> it's</c><00:09:51.120><c> better</c><00:09:51.440><c> to</c>

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
so I think we would argue it's better to
 

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.350 align:start position:0%
so I think we would argue it's better to

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that is the job yeah and and
 

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.069 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that is the job yeah and and
again<00:10:49.240><c> one</c><00:10:49.480><c> way</c><00:10:49.639><c> to</c><00:10:49.839><c> detect</c><00:10:50.240><c> this</c><00:10:50.480><c> is</c><00:10:50.680><c> that</c><00:10:50.920><c> you</c>

00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
again one way to detect this is that you
 

00:10:51.079 --> 00:10:52.629 align:start position:0%
again one way to detect this is that you
spend<00:10:51.360><c> all</c><00:10:51.519><c> your</c><00:10:51.720><c> time</c><00:10:51.920><c> paying</c><00:10:52.200><c> attention</c><00:10:52.480><c> to</c>

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
spend all your time paying attention to
 

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
spend all your time paying attention to

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
fundraising Trends and the way you come
 

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.949 align:start position:0%
fundraising Trends and the way you come
up<00:10:54.920><c> with</c><00:10:55.000><c> the</c><00:10:55.120><c> startup</c><00:10:55.480><c> idea</c><00:10:55.800><c> is</c><00:10:55.880><c> to</c><00:10:56.200><c> read</c><00:10:56.839><c> what</c>

00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
up with the startup idea is to read what
 

00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:00.030 align:start position:0%
up with the startup idea is to read what
is<00:10:57.120><c> raising</c><00:10:57.440><c> money</c><00:10:58.320><c> and</c><00:10:58.480><c> then</c><00:10:59.600><c> the</c><00:10:59.760><c> thing</c><00:10:59.920><c> that</c>

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
is raising money and then the thing that
 

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.750 align:start position:0%
is raising money and then the thing that
is<00:11:00.200><c> raising</c><00:11:00.519><c> the</c><00:11:00.680><c> most</c><00:11:00.920><c> money</c><00:11:01.720><c> yeah</c><00:11:02.560><c> and</c>

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
is raising the most money yeah and
 

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.230 align:start position:0%
is raising the most money yeah and
that's<00:11:03.000><c> the</c><00:11:03.440><c> algorithm</c><00:11:04.440><c> and</c><00:11:04.560><c> then</c><00:11:04.959><c> maybe</c>

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
that's the algorithm and then maybe
 

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.269 align:start position:0%
that's the algorithm and then maybe
raise<00:11:05.440><c> some</c><00:11:05.600><c> money</c><00:11:05.880><c> and</c><00:11:06.040><c> then</c><00:11:06.399><c> then</c><00:11:06.639><c> what</c><00:11:07.000><c> yeah</c>

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
raise some money and then then what yeah
 

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.949 align:start position:0%
raise some money and then then what yeah
like<00:11:07.519><c> that's</c><00:11:07.959><c> that</c><00:11:08.040><c> is</c><00:11:08.160><c> an</c><00:11:08.320><c> algorithm</c><00:11:08.720><c> we</c><00:11:08.839><c> see</c>

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
like that's that is an algorithm we see
 

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:10.910 align:start position:0%
like that's that is an algorithm we see
a<00:11:09.079><c> lot</c><00:11:09.279><c> from</c><00:11:09.560><c> this</c><00:11:09.800><c> type</c><00:11:10.000><c> of</c><00:11:10.160><c> thinking</c><00:11:10.760><c> which</c>

one of the reasons we usually advise to
 

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:48.990 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we usually advise to
launch<00:12:47.160><c> quickly</c><00:12:47.760><c> is</c><00:12:47.880><c> so</c><00:12:48.079><c> you</c><00:12:48.279><c> get</c><00:12:48.480><c> this</c><00:12:48.680><c> hard</c>

medicine quickly yeah that your first
 

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.110 align:start position:0%
medicine quickly yeah that your first
launch<00:12:51.920><c> is</c><00:12:52.160><c> probably</c><00:12:52.399><c> not</c><00:12:52.519><c> going</c><00:12:52.639><c> to</c><00:12:52.959><c> work</c><00:12:53.959><c> and</c>

00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
