00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
growing a little bit and um we ran into
 

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.590 align:start position:0%

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.149 align:start position:0%
could see in the next 5 minutes it was
going<00:21:55.360><c> to</c><00:21:55.480><c> determine</c><00:21:56.000><c> whether</c><00:21:56.840><c> all</c><00:21:57.000><c> that</c>

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
going to determine whether all that
 

00:21:57.159 --> 00:21:59.029 align:start position:0%
going to determine whether all that
momentum<00:21:57.600><c> was</c><00:21:57.720><c> off</c><00:21:57.880><c> for</c><00:21:58.039><c> or</c><00:21:58.200><c> not</c><00:21:58.720><c> and</c><00:21:58.840><c> it</c><00:21:58.919><c> was</c>

00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
momentum was off for or not and it was
 

00:21:59.039 --> 00:22:00.390 align:start position:0%
momentum was off for or not and it was
just<00:21:59.120><c> going</c><00:21:59.240><c> to</c><00:21:59.360><c> come</c><00:21:59.520><c> all</c><00:21:59.679><c> crashing</c><00:22:00.039><c> down</c><00:22:00.200><c> on</c>

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
just going to come all crashing down on
 

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.190 align:start position:0%
just going to come all crashing down on
us<00:22:01.200><c> and</c><00:22:01.840><c> so</c><00:22:02.840><c> after</c><00:22:03.080><c> 15</c><00:22:03.520><c> minutes</c><00:22:04.520><c> I</c><00:22:04.679><c> basically</c>

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
us and so after 15 minutes I basically
 

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.750 align:start position:0%
us and so after 15 minutes I basically
