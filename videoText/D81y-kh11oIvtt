well it's one of those sort of one-sided
 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.590 align:start position:0%
well it's one of those sort of one-sided
things<00:00:32.960><c> where</c><00:00:33.760><c> a</c><00:00:33.920><c> lot</c><00:00:34.040><c> of</c><00:00:34.280><c> people</c><00:00:34.640><c> don't</c>

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
things where a lot of people don't
 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.630 align:start position:0%
things where a lot of people don't
care<00:00:36.600><c> about</c><00:00:36.879><c> the</c><00:00:37.079><c> topic</c><00:00:37.640><c> versus</c><00:00:38.160><c> people</c><00:00:38.440><c> that</c>

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
care about the topic versus people that
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.150 align:start position:0%
care about the topic versus people that
care<00:00:38.840><c> a</c><00:00:39.000><c> lot</c><00:00:39.640><c> yeah</c><00:00:40.160><c> does</c><00:00:40.320><c> that</c><00:00:40.480><c> make</c><00:00:40.680><c> sense</c><00:00:41.079><c> and</c>

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
care a lot yeah does that make sense and
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.590 align:start position:0%
care a lot yeah does that make sense and
so<00:00:41.320><c> I</c><00:00:41.440><c> think</c><00:00:41.559><c> there's</c><00:00:41.719><c> a</c><00:00:41.840><c> lot</c><00:00:41.920><c> of</c><00:00:42.039><c> people</c><00:00:42.239><c> that</c>

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a lot of people that
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.510 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a lot of people that
strongly<00:00:43.079><c> identify</c><00:00:43.680><c> and</c><00:00:43.800><c> are</c><00:00:43.960><c> really</c><00:00:44.160><c> excited</c>

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
to raise VC from it and so I think you
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950 align:start position:0%
to raise VC from it and so I think you
watch<00:01:35.320><c> Shark</c><00:01:35.640><c> Tank</c><00:01:36.079><c> and</c><00:01:36.200><c> you</c><00:01:36.399><c> think</c><00:01:36.600><c> that</c><00:01:36.840><c> that</c>

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 align:start position:0%

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
is no reality not this industry so I
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.950 align:start position:0%
is no reality not this industry so I
think<00:01:40.399><c> that</c><00:01:40.720><c> um</c><00:01:41.600><c> that's</c><00:01:41.799><c> the</c><00:01:42.000><c> first</c><00:01:42.280><c> thing</c><00:01:42.720><c> is</c>

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
think that um that's the first thing is

but<00:02:27.599><c> I</c><00:02:27.680><c> would</c><00:02:27.920><c> guess</c><00:02:28.800><c> definitely</c><00:02:29.400><c> single</c>

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 align:start position:0%

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
digits if not less than 1% and so if you
 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.750 align:start position:0%
digits if not less than 1% and so if you
just<00:02:32.599><c> look</c><00:02:32.760><c> at</c><00:02:32.920><c> businesses</c><00:02:33.319><c> that</c><00:02:33.400><c> are</c><00:02:33.519><c> started</c>
