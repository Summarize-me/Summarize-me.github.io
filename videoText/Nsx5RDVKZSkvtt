is<00:16:46.079><c> there</c><00:16:46.279><c> such</c><00:16:46.440><c> a</c><00:16:46.600><c> thing</c><00:16:46.839><c> as</c><00:16:47.000><c> launching</c><00:16:47.399><c> too</c>

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
is there such a thing as launching too
 

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
is there such a thing as launching too
early<00:16:48.360><c> I</c><00:16:48.440><c> think</c><00:16:48.639><c> the</c><00:16:48.800><c> only</c><00:16:49.120><c> version</c><00:16:49.440><c> of</c>

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
early I think the only version of
 

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.509 align:start position:0%
early I think the only version of
launching<00:16:49.959><c> too</c><00:16:50.199><c> early</c><00:16:50.560><c> is</c><00:16:50.759><c> when</c><00:16:50.959><c> your</c><00:16:51.199><c> product</c>

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
launching too early is when your product
 

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:54.269 align:start position:0%
launching too early is when your product
doesn't<00:16:51.880><c> actually</c><00:16:52.160><c> work</c><00:16:52.639><c> it</c><00:16:52.800><c> add</c><00:16:53.040><c> no</c><00:16:53.319><c> value</c>

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually work it add no value
 

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.710 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually work it add no value
you<00:16:54.399><c> know</c><00:16:54.639><c> it's</c><00:16:54.759><c> like</c><00:16:54.959><c> the</c><00:16:55.240><c> the</c><00:16:55.319><c> website's</c>
