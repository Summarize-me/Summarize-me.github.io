yeah well you know I would always I
would<00:04:55.340><c> always</c><00:04:55.430><c> start</c><00:04:55.610><c> off</c><00:04:55.789><c> thinking</c><00:04:56.180><c> about</c><00:04:56.360><c> an</c>

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 align:start position:0%
would always start off thinking about an
 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.300 align:start position:0%
would always start off thinking about an
idea<00:04:56.660><c> and</c><00:04:56.930><c> I</c><00:04:57.139><c> I</c><00:04:57.380><c> had</c><00:04:57.560><c> some</c><00:04:57.740><c> friends</c><00:04:57.979><c> that</c><00:04:58.160><c> were</c>

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
idea and I I had some friends that were
 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.980 align:start position:0%
idea and I I had some friends that were
technical<00:04:58.760><c> and</c><00:04:58.880><c> then</c><00:04:58.970><c> none</c><00:04:59.360><c> of</c><00:04:59.389><c> us</c><00:04:59.539><c> were</c><00:04:59.690><c> super</c>

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 align:start position:0%
technical and then none of us were super
 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.420 align:start position:0%
technical and then none of us were super
technical<00:05:00.440><c> so</c><00:05:00.680><c> we'd</c><00:05:00.800><c> always</c><00:05:00.949><c> just</c><00:05:01.220><c> sort</c><00:05:01.370><c> of</c>

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 align:start position:0%
technical so we'd always just sort of
 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.219 align:start position:0%
technical so we'd always just sort of
chip<00:05:01.639><c> in</c><00:05:01.789><c> and</c><00:05:02.150><c> learn</c><00:05:02.360><c> what</c><00:05:02.690><c> we</c><00:05:02.780><c> needed</c><00:05:02.990><c> to</c><00:05:03.139><c> do</c>

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 align:start position:0%
chip in and learn what we needed to do
 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.409 align:start position:0%
chip in and learn what we needed to do
to<00:05:03.260><c> get</c><00:05:03.500><c> the</c><00:05:03.590><c> next</c><00:05:03.770><c> part</c><00:05:04.039><c> I'm</c><00:05:04.639><c> so</c><00:05:04.940><c> learning</c>

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 align:start position:0%
to get the next part I'm so learning
 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.500 align:start position:0%

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 align:start position:0%
know I would you like simple like
 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.290 align:start position:0%
know I would you like simple like

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 align:start position:0%
