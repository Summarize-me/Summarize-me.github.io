00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:54.570 align:start position:0%
that's all these visuals and and so the
 

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's all these visuals and and so the
the<00:08:54.960><c> where</c><00:08:55.440><c> the</c><00:08:55.530><c> rubber</c><00:08:55.710><c> hits</c><00:08:55.800><c> the</c><00:08:55.980><c> road</c><00:08:56.070><c> is</c>

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.370 align:start position:0%
the where the rubber hits the road is
 

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.010 align:start position:0%
the where the rubber hits the road is
when<00:08:56.550><c> you</c><00:08:56.640><c> start</c><00:08:57.000><c> watching</c>

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
when you start watching
 

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.350 align:start position:0%
when you start watching
the<00:08:58.350><c> usage</c><00:08:58.740><c> I</c><00:08:59.010><c> mean</c><00:08:59.670><c> is</c><00:08:59.730><c> like</c><00:08:59.760><c> they'd</c><00:09:00.000><c> say</c><00:09:00.180><c> it's</c>

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
the usage I mean is like they'd say it's
 

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
the usage I mean is like they'd say it's
so<00:09:00.510><c> interesting</c><00:09:01.050><c> and</c><00:09:01.170><c> then</c><00:09:01.290><c> it</c><00:09:01.410><c> was</c><00:09:01.530><c> just</c><00:09:01.880><c> like</c>

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
so interesting and then it was just like
 

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
so interesting and then it was just like
that<00:09:03.060><c> so</c><00:09:03.480><c> we</c><00:09:04.260><c> reached</c><00:09:04.470><c> a</c><00:09:04.620><c> point</c><00:09:04.800><c> where</c><00:09:04.980><c> I</c>

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.010 align:start position:0%
that so we reached a point where I
 

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.970 align:start position:0%
that so we reached a point where I
remember<00:09:05.430><c> Keith</c><00:09:05.670><c> said</c><00:09:06.530><c> like</c><00:09:07.530><c> it</c><00:09:07.860><c> was</c>

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
remember Keith said like it was
 

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
remember Keith said like it was
heartbreaking<00:09:08.340><c> to</c><00:09:08.730><c> me</c><00:09:08.760><c> he's</c><00:09:08.940><c> like</c><00:09:08.970><c> we're</c>

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:09.450 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking to me he's like we're
 

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.310 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking to me he's like we're
going<00:09:09.660><c> to</c><00:09:09.750><c> pivot</c><00:09:10.280><c> again</c><00:09:11.280><c> again</c><00:09:12.180><c> this</c><00:09:12.840><c> is</c><00:09:13.050><c> wrong</c>

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to pivot again again this is wrong
 

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
going to pivot again again this is wrong
and<00:09:13.620><c> I</c><00:09:13.770><c> was</c><00:09:13.860><c> like</c><00:09:13.950><c> no</c><00:09:14.070><c> no</c><00:09:14.220><c> no</c><00:09:14.250><c> no</c><00:09:14.460><c> we</c><00:09:14.550><c> just</c><00:09:14.730><c> got</c>

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:14.850 align:start position:0%
and I was like no no no no we just got
 

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.310 align:start position:0%
and I was like no no no no we just got
to<00:09:14.910><c> give</c><00:09:15.000><c> it</c><00:09:15.060><c> a</c><00:09:15.120><c> few</c><00:09:15.210><c> more</c><00:09:15.360><c> weeks</c><00:09:15.480><c> no</c><00:09:15.900><c> no</c><00:09:15.960><c> this</c>

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
to give it a few more weeks no no this
 

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
to give it a few more weeks no no this
is<00:09:16.440><c> wrong</c><00:09:16.560><c> you</c><00:09:16.880><c> remember</c><00:09:17.880><c> this</c><00:09:18.000><c> moment</c>

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.130 align:start position:0%
a lot of value for teachers and for
 

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of value for teachers and for
students<00:20:02.400><c> and</c><00:20:02.550><c> so</c><00:20:02.670><c> that</c><00:20:02.820><c> was</c><00:20:03.000><c> sort</c><00:20:03.300><c> of</c><00:20:03.330><c> step</c>

the the hardest part of the business was
gosh<00:20:36.270><c> was</c><00:20:36.840><c> it</c><00:20:36.960><c> before</c><00:20:37.080><c> after</c><00:20:37.560><c> that</c><00:20:37.710><c> that</c><00:20:37.920><c> we</c>

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.010 align:start position:0%
gosh was it before after that that we
 

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:39.740 align:start position:0%
gosh was it before after that that we
almost<00:20:38.130><c> ran</c><00:20:38.340><c> out</c><00:20:38.460><c> of</c><00:20:38.520><c> money</c><00:20:38.730><c> a</c><00:20:38.820><c> kit</c><00:20:39.030><c> that</c><00:20:39.210><c> was</c>

almost ran out of money a kit that was
 

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
almost ran out of money a kit that was
after<00:20:39.930><c> that</c><00:20:40.230><c> it</c><00:20:40.440><c> was</c><00:20:40.530><c> right</c><00:20:40.680><c> after</c><00:20:40.890><c> that</c><00:20:41.040><c> okay</c>

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:41.490 align:start position:0%
after that it was right after that okay
 

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
after that it was right after that okay
so<00:20:41.550><c> so</c><00:20:42.450><c> yeah</c><00:20:42.720><c> we</c><00:20:42.900><c> had</c><00:20:43.490><c> we</c><00:20:44.490><c> it</c><00:20:45.300><c> was</c><00:20:45.510><c> not</c><00:20:45.690><c> obvious</c>

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:45.930 align:start position:0%
so so yeah we had we it was not obvious
 

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.690 align:start position:0%
so so yeah we had we it was not obvious
that<00:20:46.140><c> we</c><00:20:46.350><c> could</c><00:20:46.500><c> sell</c><00:20:46.740><c> and</c><00:20:47.070><c> we</c><00:20:47.340><c> were</c><00:20:47.460><c> almost</c>

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
that we could sell and we were almost
 

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.850 align:start position:0%
that we could sell and we were almost
