of like athletic directors for instance
 

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
of like athletic directors for instance
and<00:11:41.390><c> they</c><00:11:41.510><c> were</c><00:11:41.600><c> wonderful</c><00:11:42.110><c> but</c><00:11:42.320><c> it</c><00:11:42.740><c> was</c><00:11:42.860><c> also</c>

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.010 align:start position:0%
and they were wonderful but it was also
 

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.250 align:start position:0%
and they were wonderful but it was also
hard<00:11:43.250><c> for</c><00:11:43.460><c> them</c><00:11:43.580><c> to</c><00:11:43.730><c> purchase</c><00:11:44.090><c> so</c><00:11:44.510><c> it</c><00:11:44.630><c> took</c>

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:45.260 align:start position:0%
hard for them to purchase so it took
 

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
hard for them to purchase so it took
some<00:11:45.470><c> time</c><00:11:45.500><c> to</c><00:11:46.010><c> figure</c><00:11:46.550><c> that</c><00:11:46.730><c> part</c><00:11:46.940><c> out</c><00:11:47.120><c> and</c>

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.330 align:start position:0%
some time to figure that part out and
 

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.930 align:start position:0%
some time to figure that part out and
again<00:11:47.930><c> I</c><00:11:47.990><c> think</c><00:11:48.170><c> part</c><00:11:49.040><c> of</c><00:11:49.100><c> that</c><00:11:49.160><c> is</c><00:11:49.250><c> due</c><00:11:49.610><c> to</c><00:11:49.640><c> the</c>

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:49.940 align:start position:0%
again I think part of that is due to the
 

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
again I think part of that is due to the
specific<00:11:50.300><c> problem</c><00:11:50.870><c> that</c><00:11:50.900><c> we're</c><00:11:51.110><c> solving</c><00:11:51.350><c> and</c>

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:51.770 align:start position:0%
specific problem that we're solving and
 

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:53.810 align:start position:0%
how we're doing that so the market half
 

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.100 align:start position:0%
how we're doing that so the market half
of<00:11:54.050><c> product</c><00:11:54.470><c> market</c><00:11:54.830><c> fit</c><00:11:54.880><c> you</c><00:11:55.880><c> were</c><00:11:56.120><c> searching</c>

takes a lot of time and effort to work
 

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.750 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time and effort to work
on<00:20:28.760><c> that</c><00:20:28.970><c> and</c><00:20:29.300><c> so</c><00:20:30.050><c> it</c><00:20:30.440><c> was</c><00:20:30.800><c> for</c><00:20:30.980><c> us</c><00:20:31.160><c> like</c><00:20:31.640><c> we</c>

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
on that and so it was for us like we
 

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.190 align:start position:0%
on that and so it was for us like we
sort<00:20:31.910><c> of</c><00:20:32.030><c> came</c><00:20:32.210><c> after</c><00:20:32.480><c> a</c><00:20:32.540><c> couple</c><00:20:32.690><c> of</c><00:20:32.780><c> months</c><00:20:33.080><c> to</c>

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
sort of came after a couple of months to
 

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.510 align:start position:0%
sort of came after a couple of months to
the<00:20:33.230><c> realization</c><00:20:33.920><c> that</c><00:20:33.950><c> it</c><00:20:34.130><c> was</c><00:20:34.220><c> time</c><00:20:34.370><c> and</c>

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
the realization that it was time and
 

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.950 align:start position:0%
the realization that it was time and
effort<00:20:34.760><c> away</c><00:20:34.910><c> from</c><00:20:35.120><c> building</c><00:20:35.450><c> the</c><00:20:35.480><c> product</c>

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
effort away from building the product
 

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.260 align:start position:0%
effort away from building the product
and<00:20:36.260><c> building</c><00:20:37.130><c> like</c><00:20:37.490><c> our</c><00:20:37.910><c> go-to-market</c>

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.270 align:start position:0%
and building like our go-to-market
 

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.090 align:start position:0%
and building like our go-to-market
strategy<00:20:38.360><c> which</c><00:20:39.110><c> is</c><00:20:39.260><c> what</c><00:20:39.410><c> we</c><00:20:39.530><c> really</c><00:20:39.740><c> needed</c>

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:40.100 align:start position:0%
strategy which is what we really needed
 

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.510 align:start position:0%
strategy which is what we really needed
so<00:20:40.820><c> we</c><00:20:41.000><c> did</c><00:20:41.210><c> after</c><00:20:41.690><c> I'm</c><00:20:42.260><c> gonna</c><00:20:42.800><c> say</c><00:20:43.040><c> like</c><00:20:43.280><c> three</c>

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
so we did after I'm gonna say like three
 

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.370 align:start position:0%
so we did after I'm gonna say like three
or<00:20:43.610><c> four</c><00:20:43.670><c> months</c><00:20:44.090><c> just</c><00:20:44.300><c> we</c><00:20:44.930><c> were</c><00:20:45.050><c> like</c><00:20:45.200><c> we're</c>

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:45.380 align:start position:0%
or four months just we were like we're
 

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.850 align:start position:0%
or four months just we were like we're
not<00:20:45.410><c> ready</c><00:20:45.740><c> so</c><00:20:46.430><c> we</c><00:20:46.610><c> started</c><00:20:46.910><c> focusing</c><00:20:47.030><c> again</c>

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:47.860 align:start position:0%
not ready so we started focusing again
 

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.310 align:start position:0%
not ready so we started focusing again
back<00:20:48.860><c> more</c><00:20:49.520><c> entirely</c><00:20:50.060><c> just</c><00:20:50.540><c> on</c><00:20:50.750><c> product</c><00:20:51.200><c> and</c>

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
back more entirely just on product and
 

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.940 align:start position:0%
back more entirely just on product and
getting<00:20:51.500><c> pilots</c><00:20:52.040><c> in</c><00:20:52.630><c> a</c><00:20:53.830><c> couple</c><00:20:54.830><c> of</c><00:20:54.860><c> things</c>

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
getting pilots in a couple of things
 

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.020 align:start position:0%
getting pilots in a couple of things
there<00:20:55.430><c> I</c><00:20:55.490><c> think</c><00:20:57.130><c> so</c><00:20:58.130><c> in</c><00:20:58.310><c> the</c><00:20:58.430><c> time</c><00:20:58.670><c> we</c><00:20:58.880><c> were</c>

00:20:59.020 --> 00:20:59.030 align:start position:0%
there I think so in the time we were
 

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.780 align:start position:0%
there I think so in the time we were
pitching<00:20:59.330><c> we</c><00:21:00.290><c> focused</c><00:21:00.800><c> a</c><00:21:00.920><c> lot</c><00:21:01.070><c> at</c><00:21:01.190><c> the</c><00:21:01.310><c> time</c><00:21:01.340><c> on</c>

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:01.790 align:start position:0%
pitching we focused a lot at the time on
 

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.230 align:start position:0%
pitching we focused a lot at the time on
creating<00:21:02.210><c> our</c><00:21:02.330><c> deck</c><00:21:02.690><c> and</c><00:21:02.960><c> I</c><00:21:03.560><c> think</c><00:21:03.940><c> our</c><00:21:04.940><c> deck</c>

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
creating our deck and I think our deck
 

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.390 align:start position:0%
creating our deck and I think our deck
probably<00:21:05.780><c> went</c><00:21:05.960><c> from</c><00:21:06.110><c> like</c><00:21:06.290><c> 10</c><00:21:06.530><c> flies</c><00:21:06.770><c> to</c><00:21:07.100><c> over</c>

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
probably went from like 10 flies to over
 

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.100 align:start position:0%
probably went from like 10 flies to over
40<00:21:07.760><c> at</c><00:21:07.940><c> some</c><00:21:08.150><c> point</c><00:21:08.420><c> you</c><00:21:08.690><c> go</c><00:21:08.840><c> to</c><00:21:08.900><c> these</c>

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
40 at some point you go to these
 

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.900 align:start position:0%
