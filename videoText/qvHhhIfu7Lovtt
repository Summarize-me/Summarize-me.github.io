00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:10.730 align:start position:0%
should focus almost too much on the

measure success of the product is users
 

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.940 align:start position:0%
measure success of the product is users
and<00:29:19.130><c> you</c><00:29:19.910><c> will</c><00:29:20.090><c> keep</c><00:29:20.390><c> tweaking</c><00:29:20.960><c> that</c><00:29:21.350><c> product</c>

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:21.950 align:start position:0%
and you will keep tweaking that product
 

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
and you will keep tweaking that product
until<00:29:23.140><c> user</c><00:29:24.140><c> growth</c><00:29:24.620><c> starts</c><00:29:25.160><c> to</c><00:29:25.340><c> explode</c><00:29:26.000><c> and</c>

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:26.590 align:start position:0%
until user growth starts to explode and
 

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:30.790 align:start position:0%
until user growth starts to explode and
then<00:29:27.590><c> you</c><00:29:27.830><c> you</c><00:29:28.160><c> jump</c><00:29:28.520><c> for</c><00:29:28.820><c> joy</c><00:29:28.850><c> and</c><00:29:29.660><c> and</c><00:29:30.140><c> go</c><00:29:30.500><c> for</c>

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
then you you jump for joy and and go for
 

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.460 align:start position:0%
then you you jump for joy and and go for
billions<00:29:31.400><c> of</c><00:29:31.670><c> them</c><00:29:31.970><c> so</c><00:29:32.720><c> you</c><00:29:32.780><c> focus</c><00:29:33.140><c> on</c><00:29:33.350><c> the</c>
