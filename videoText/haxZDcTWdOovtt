significantly different from company
these<00:02:13.040><c> and</c><00:02:14.040><c> so</c><00:02:14.340><c> what</c><00:02:14.459><c> you</c><00:02:14.550><c> have</c><00:02:14.849><c> is</c><00:02:15.300><c> a</c>

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.509 align:start position:0%
what comes out a bit of a larger stage I

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
have both those people and so it's about
 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.360 align:start position:0%

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:48.650 align:start position:0%
and so the first problem is it actually
 

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
and so the first problem is it actually
being<00:17:48.830><c> a</c><00:17:48.980><c> better</c><00:17:49.610><c> general</c><00:17:49.970><c> predictor</c><00:17:50.300><c> of</c>

being a better general predictor of

let's<00:18:33.020><c> break</c><00:18:33.200><c> up</c><00:18:33.410><c> a</c><00:18:33.440><c> part</c><00:18:33.770><c> yeah</c><00:18:33.950><c> new</c><00:18:34.190><c> grads</c>

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
let's break up a part yeah new grads
 

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.530 align:start position:0%
let's break up a part yeah new grads
okay<00:18:35.090><c> for</c><00:18:35.720><c> new</c><00:18:35.900><c> grads</c><00:18:36.140><c> I</c><00:18:36.680><c> would</c><00:18:37.430><c> say</c><00:18:37.760><c> you</c><00:18:38.480><c> know</c>

it's<00:29:53.539><c> enter</c><00:29:53.720><c> college</c><00:29:53.899><c> would</c><00:29:53.960><c> be</c><00:29:54.019><c> screened</c><00:29:54.230><c> out</c>

it's enter college would be screened out
 

00:29:54.379 --> 00:29:59.710 align:start position:0%
it's enter college would be screened out
um<00:29:56.860><c> and</c><00:29:57.860><c> so</c><00:29:57.950><c> the</c><00:29:58.039><c> solution</c><00:29:58.370><c> there</c><00:29:58.610><c> it's</c><00:29:59.570><c> just</c>

um and so the solution there it's just

00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:01.639 align:start position:0%
to be really consistent okay so like the

sense of how they are in those areas and
then<00:32:32.300><c> just</c><00:32:32.870><c> like</c><00:32:32.990><c> you</c><00:32:33.110><c> know</c><00:32:33.200><c> but</c><00:32:33.320><c> my</c><00:32:33.410><c> advice</c>

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:33.500 align:start position:0%
then just like you know but my advice
 

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
then just like you know but my advice
generally<00:32:34.010><c> is</c><00:32:34.130><c> to</c><00:32:34.160><c> decide</c><00:32:34.580><c> what</c><00:32:34.790><c> what</c><00:32:35.060><c> the</c>

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:35.210 align:start position:0%
generally is to decide what what the
 

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.690 align:start position:0%
generally is to decide what what the
skills<00:32:35.510><c> that</c><00:32:35.810><c> that</c><00:32:36.020><c> you</c><00:32:36.650><c> preference</c><00:32:37.220><c> mm-hmm</c>

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:37.700 align:start position:0%
skills that that you preference mm-hmm
 

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.140 align:start position:0%
skills that that you preference mm-hmm
and<00:32:38.060><c> so</c><00:32:38.150><c> I</c><00:32:38.210><c> think</c><00:32:38.300><c> we</c><00:32:38.600><c> we</c><00:32:39.470><c> preference</c><00:32:39.950><c> I</c><00:32:40.280><c> a</c>

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:41.150 align:start position:0%
and so I think we we preference I a
 

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.380 align:start position:0%
and so I think we we preference I a
couple<00:32:41.750><c> things</c><00:32:41.840><c> we</c><00:32:42.770><c> preference</c><00:32:43.250><c> and</c><00:32:44.210><c> data</c>

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:44.390 align:start position:0%
couple things we preference and data
 

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
couple things we preference and data
analysis<00:32:44.870><c> is</c><00:32:45.050><c> pretty</c><00:32:45.380><c> key</c><00:32:45.740><c> to</c><00:32:45.860><c> our</c><00:32:45.920><c> business</c>

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:46.250 align:start position:0%

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.510 align:start position:0%
analysis is pretty key to our business
and<00:32:46.790><c> so</c><00:32:47.060><c> we</c><00:32:47.090><c> preference</c><00:32:47.870><c> people</c><00:32:48.170><c> being</c>
