00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:39.410 align:start position:0%
process I took a lot of learning I think
 

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.780 align:start position:0%
process I took a lot of learning I think
that<00:12:39.680><c> that's</c><00:12:39.770><c> important</c><00:12:40.250><c> to</c><00:12:40.340><c> talk</c><00:12:40.490><c> about</c><00:12:40.550><c> I</c>

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:40.790 align:start position:0%
that that's important to talk about I
 

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
that that's important to talk about I
think<00:12:40.940><c> like</c><00:12:41.210><c> we</c><00:12:41.390><c> don't</c><00:12:41.510><c> talk</c><00:12:41.780><c> about</c><00:12:41.930><c> it</c><00:12:42.170><c> too</c>

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.410 align:start position:0%
think like we don't talk about it too
 

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.900 align:start position:0%
think like we don't talk about it too
much<00:12:42.560><c> but</c><00:12:42.860><c> I</c><00:12:42.920><c> think</c><00:12:42.980><c> that</c><00:12:43.280><c> there's</c><00:12:43.460><c> a</c><00:12:43.520><c> lot</c><00:12:43.700><c> more</c>

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
much but I think that there's a lot more
 

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.730 align:start position:0%
much but I think that there's a lot more
to<00:12:44.030><c> fundraising</c><00:12:44.390><c> than</c><00:12:44.630><c> like</c><00:12:44.780><c> valuation</c><00:12:45.410><c> yeah</c>

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:45.740 align:start position:0%

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:14.510 align:start position:0%
future it's just things too or if you're
 

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
future it's just things too or if you're
considering<00:13:15.110><c> an</c><00:13:15.260><c> acquisition</c><00:13:15.770><c> it</c><00:13:15.890><c> may</c><00:13:15.980><c> affect</c>

considering an acquisition it may affect
 

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.580 align:start position:0%
considering an acquisition it may affect

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:18.590 align:start position:0%
that so I think that it's just something
 

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.020 align:start position:0%
that so I think that it's just something
