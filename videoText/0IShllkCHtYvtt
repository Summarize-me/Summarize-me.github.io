00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely must
 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.069 align:start position:0%
absolutely must
so<00:00:32.399><c> dalton</c><00:00:32.960><c> i</c><00:00:33.040><c> think</c><00:00:33.200><c> the</c><00:00:33.360><c> cool</c><00:00:33.600><c> way</c><00:00:33.760><c> to</c><00:00:33.840><c> think</c>

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
so dalton i think the cool way to think
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.750 align:start position:0%
so dalton i think the cool way to think
about<00:00:34.320><c> this</c><00:00:34.640><c> is</c><00:00:34.719><c> a</c><00:00:34.800><c> little</c><00:00:34.960><c> bit</c><00:00:35.200><c> like</c><00:00:35.440><c> health</c>

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
about this is a little bit like health
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.310 align:start position:0%
about this is a little bit like health
care<00:00:36.079><c> there's</c><00:00:36.399><c> preventative</c><00:00:37.120><c> health</c><00:00:37.440><c> care</c>

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
care there's preventative health care
 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.790 align:start position:0%
care there's preventative health care
and<00:00:38.399><c> then</c><00:00:38.640><c> there's</c><00:00:39.040><c> you</c><00:00:39.200><c> know</c><00:00:39.520><c> treatment</c>

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then there's you know treatment
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.709 align:start position:0%
and then there's you know treatment
so<00:00:40.960><c> let's</c><00:00:41.120><c> start</c><00:00:41.360><c> with</c><00:00:41.600><c> the</c><00:00:41.840><c> preventative</c><00:00:42.480><c> and</c>

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
so let's start with the preventative and
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.709 align:start position:0%
so let's start with the preventative and
let's<00:00:42.960><c> set</c><00:00:43.120><c> the</c><00:00:43.440><c> set</c><00:00:43.600><c> the</c><00:00:44.000><c> framework</c><00:00:44.480><c> here</c>

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
let's set the set the framework here
 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:45.670 align:start position:0%
let's set the set the framework here
like

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.670 align:start position:0%
like
a<00:00:45.840><c> lot</c><00:00:46.000><c> of</c><00:00:46.160><c> times</c><00:00:46.640><c> founders</c><00:00:47.120><c> get</c><00:00:47.280><c> punched</c><00:00:47.600><c> in</c>

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of times founders get punched in
 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.630 align:start position:0%
a lot of times founders get punched in
the<00:00:47.760><c> face</c><00:00:48.239><c> as</c><00:00:48.559><c> almost</c><00:00:49.039><c> unforced</c><00:00:49.680><c> errors</c><00:00:50.480><c> it's</c>

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
the face as almost unforced errors it's
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 align:start position:0%
the face as almost unforced errors it's
like<00:00:50.800><c> a</c><00:00:50.879><c> result</c><00:00:51.199><c> of</c><00:00:51.360><c> magical</c><00:00:51.920><c> thinking</c><00:00:52.399><c> or</c>

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
like a result of magical thinking or
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
like a result of magical thinking or

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
being set up and so
 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.069 align:start position:0%
being set up and so
here<00:00:56.079><c> are</c><00:00:56.320><c> things</c><00:00:56.640><c> you</c><00:00:56.800><c> can</c><00:00:57.039><c> do</c><00:00:57.520><c> to</c><00:00:57.760><c> either</c>

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
here are things you can do to either
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.069 align:start position:0%
here are things you can do to either
reduce<00:00:58.559><c> the</c><00:00:58.640><c> number</c><00:00:58.879><c> of</c><00:00:58.960><c> punches</c><00:00:59.440><c> that</c><00:00:59.680><c> come</c>

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of punches that come
 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of punches that come
or<00:01:00.320><c> at</c><00:01:00.399><c> least</c><00:01:00.640><c> reduce</c><00:01:01.039><c> their</c><00:01:01.199><c> intensity</c>

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
or at least reduce their intensity
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
or at least reduce their intensity
because<00:01:01.840><c> you</c><00:01:02.000><c> have</c><00:01:02.640><c> your</c><00:01:02.879><c> other</c><00:01:03.440><c> locked</c>

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 align:start position:0%

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.990 align:start position:0%
because you have your other locked
up<00:01:04.400><c> does</c><00:01:04.559><c> that</c><00:01:04.640><c> make</c><00:01:04.799><c> sense</c>

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
up does that make sense
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.149 align:start position:0%
up does that make sense
yeah<00:01:06.320><c> exactly</c><00:01:07.040><c> it's</c><00:01:07.200><c> like</c>

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly it's like
