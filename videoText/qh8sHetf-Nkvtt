other kind of question I asked which is
an<00:06:33.720><c> extension</c><00:06:34.710><c> of</c><00:06:34.800><c> this</c><00:06:34.979><c> is</c><00:06:35.220><c> like</c><00:06:35.430><c> if</c><00:06:36.150><c> I</c><00:06:36.539><c> think</c>

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
an extension of this is like if I think
 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.779 align:start position:0%
an extension of this is like if I think
about<00:06:37.050><c> the</c><00:06:37.229><c> moments</c><00:06:37.800><c> where</c><00:06:38.190><c> I</c><00:06:38.460><c> outperform</c>

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:39.789 align:start position:0%
about the moments where I outperform
 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
about the moments where I outperform
so<00:06:40.479><c> not</c><00:06:40.660><c> only</c><00:06:40.810><c> was</c><00:06:40.990><c> I</c><00:06:41.110><c> released</c><00:06:41.470><c> from</c><00:06:41.590><c> than</c><00:06:41.740><c> one</c>

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:41.830 align:start position:0%
so not only was I released from than one
 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.469 align:start position:0%
