00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:04.770 align:start position:0%
it was a more effective way of kind of

it was a more effective way of kind of

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:43.650 align:start position:0%
gauging interest so he's asking is like
 

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.590 align:start position:0%

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:04.110 align:start position:0%
like it get lab yes that's pretty much
 

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.900 align:start position:0%
like it get lab yes that's pretty much
