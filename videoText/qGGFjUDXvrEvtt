00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:26.630 align:start position:0%
resistant depression so it meant they
 

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.180 align:start position:0%

it's I mean I think sometimes it works

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:32.730 align:start position:0%
on the antidepressants is because when
 

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
on the antidepressants is because when
they<00:20:32.820><c> try</c><00:20:33.000><c> and</c><00:20:33.059><c> go</c><00:20:33.150><c> off</c><00:20:33.300><c> them</c><00:20:33.480><c> it's</c><00:20:33.690><c> awful</c>

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:34.650 align:start position:0%
they try and go off them it's awful

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
with our participants is that the
 

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.740 align:start position:0%
with our participants is that the
depression<00:24:28.740><c> came</c><00:24:28.890><c> back</c><00:24:29.070><c> after</c><00:24:29.310><c> three</c><00:24:30.240><c> months</c>

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:30.750 align:start position:0%
depression came back after three months
 

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.690 align:start position:0%
depression came back after three months
or<00:24:30.900><c> so</c><00:24:31.050><c> mmm</c><00:24:31.620><c> I</c><00:24:31.740><c> mean</c><00:24:32.070><c> it</c><00:24:32.190><c> makes</c><00:24:32.340><c> sense</c><00:24:32.580><c> right</c>

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
or so mmm I mean it makes sense right
 

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
or so mmm I mean it makes sense right
your<00:24:33.210><c> life</c><00:24:33.420><c> is</c><00:24:33.600><c> already</c><00:24:33.720><c> structured</c><00:24:34.260><c> in</c><00:24:34.380><c> such</c>

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:45.700 align:start position:0%
be all I needed to stay in shape though
 

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.489 align:start position:0%
be all I needed to stay in shape though
yeah<00:29:45.909><c> amazing</c><00:29:46.240><c> so</c><00:29:46.899><c> it's</c><00:29:47.049><c> incredibly</c>

00:29:47.489 --> 00:29:47.499 align:start position:0%

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:51.190 align:start position:0%
that you have to keep at it yeah and so
 

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.269 align:start position:0%

00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
so I think the match is important in the
 

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:31.029 align:start position:0%
so I think the match is important in the

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:41.180 align:start position:0%
had a good outcome but I think
 

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.670 align:start position:0%
had a good outcome but I think

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:45.050 align:start position:0%
