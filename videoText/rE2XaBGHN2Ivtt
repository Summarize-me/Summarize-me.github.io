00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
know I think it's it makes sense to
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 align:start position:0%
know I think it's it makes sense to
split<00:01:21.060><c> this</c><00:01:21.180><c> up</c><00:01:21.299><c> into</c><00:01:21.600><c> mistakes</c><00:01:22.560><c> that</c><00:01:22.799><c> people</c>

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 align:start position:0%
split this up into mistakes that people
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 align:start position:0%

make setting goals and then mistakes
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.170 align:start position:0%
make setting goals and then mistakes
people<00:01:25.380><c> make</c><00:01:25.680><c> trying</c><00:01:25.860><c> to</c><00:01:26.040><c> accomplish</c><00:01:26.520><c> these</c>

people make trying to accomplish these
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.950 align:start position:0%
people make trying to accomplish these
goals<00:01:27.479><c> so</c><00:01:28.140><c> I</c><00:01:28.560><c> would</c><00:01:28.680><c> say</c><00:01:28.799><c> like</c><00:01:28.979><c> the</c><00:01:29.340><c> first</c><00:01:29.520><c> one</c>

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 align:start position:0%

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
like well I guess
 

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.630 align:start position:0%
like well I guess
I<00:11:21.959><c> guess</c><00:11:22.079><c> this</c><00:11:22.260><c> worked</c><00:11:22.620><c> I</c><00:11:23.040><c> guess</c><00:11:23.160><c> this</c><00:11:23.339><c> is</c><00:11:23.459><c> how</c>

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
I guess this worked I guess this is how
 

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.769 align:start position:0%
I guess this worked I guess this is how
this<00:11:23.820><c> goes</c>

00:11:24.769 --> 00:11:24.779 align:start position:0%
this goes
 

00:11:24.779 --> 00:11:28.190 align:start position:0%
this goes
so<00:11:25.800><c> um</c><00:11:25.860><c> another</c><00:11:26.160><c> way</c><00:11:26.459><c> that</c><00:11:26.700><c> people</c><00:11:26.940><c> screw</c><00:11:27.600><c> up</c>

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
so um another way that people screw up
 

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.870 align:start position:0%
so um another way that people screw up
the<00:11:28.380><c> accomplishing</c><00:11:28.920><c> goals</c><00:11:29.279><c> is</c><00:11:29.640><c> not</c>

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
the accomplishing goals is not
 

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.030 align:start position:0%
the accomplishing goals is not
understanding<00:11:30.360><c> how</c><00:11:30.660><c> to</c><00:11:30.779><c> take</c><00:11:30.959><c> the</c><00:11:31.200><c> L</c>
