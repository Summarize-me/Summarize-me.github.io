state of the infrastructure where
 

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.170 align:start position:0%
state of the infrastructure where
yeah<00:39:35.900><c> okay</c><00:39:36.290><c> so</c><00:39:36.350><c> I</c><00:39:36.470><c> will</c><00:39:36.620><c> say</c><00:39:36.980><c> this</c><00:39:37.400><c> is</c><00:39:37.520><c> a</c><00:39:37.550><c> very</c>

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:38.180 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so I will say this is a very
 

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so I will say this is a very
exciting<00:39:38.510><c> time</c><00:39:38.720><c> to</c><00:39:38.930><c> be</c><00:39:39.140><c> building</c><00:39:40.070><c> for</c><00:39:40.130><c> Africa</c>

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:40.730 align:start position:0%

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:41.290 align:start position:0%
exciting time to be building for Africa
okay

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:41.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.500 align:start position:0%
okay
I<00:39:41.330><c> think</c><00:39:42.370><c> because</c><00:39:43.370><c> there's</c><00:39:43.790><c> a</c><00:39:43.880><c> very</c><00:39:44.090><c> young</c>

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:44.510 align:start position:0%
I think because there's a very young
 

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.850 align:start position:0%
I think because there's a very young
population<00:39:45.280><c> I</c><00:39:46.280><c> think</c><00:39:46.820><c> for</c><00:39:46.970><c> context</c><00:39:47.570><c> in</c><00:39:47.870><c> 19</c>

okay<00:39:49.370><c> this</c><00:39:49.760><c> is</c><00:39:49.910><c> good</c><00:39:50.180><c> to</c><00:39:50.270><c> be</c><00:39:50.330><c> ready</c><00:39:50.540><c> I</c><00:39:51.050><c> don't</c>

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay this is good to be ready I don't

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:16.430 align:start position:0%
like in the next five years I think
 

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:18.430 align:start position:0%
like in the next five years I think
manager<00:40:16.940><c> is</c><00:40:17.090><c> going</c><00:40:17.240><c> to</c><00:40:17.360><c> be</c><00:40:17.450><c> even</c><00:40:17.570><c> more</c><00:40:18.230><c> than</c>

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
manager is going to be even more than
 

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
manager is going to be even more than
the<00:40:18.560><c> US</c><00:40:18.890><c> so</c><00:40:19.610><c> the</c><00:40:19.640><c> population</c><00:40:20.360><c> is</c><00:40:20.450><c> young</c><00:40:21.220><c> active</c>

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:22.330 align:start position:0%
the US so the population is young active
 

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:27.580 align:start position:0%
the US so the population is young active
like<00:40:24.370><c> have</c><00:40:25.370><c> access</c><00:40:25.700><c> phones</c><00:40:26.120><c> and</c><00:40:26.990><c> all</c><00:40:27.170><c> that</c><00:40:27.410><c> so</c>

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:27.590 align:start position:0%
like have access phones and all that so
 

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.070 align:start position:0%
like have access phones and all that so
if<00:40:27.740><c> this</c><00:40:28.010><c> is</c><00:40:28.160><c> the</c><00:40:28.190><c> right</c><00:40:28.460><c> time</c><00:40:28.520><c> to</c><00:40:28.940><c> build</c><00:40:29.240><c> for</c>
