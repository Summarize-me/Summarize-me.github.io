00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
product at that point desktop product
 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.010 align:start position:0%
product at that point desktop product
and<00:06:43.319><c> so</c><00:06:43.620><c> we</c><00:06:43.800><c> thought</c><00:06:43.979><c> well</c><00:06:44.340><c> let's</c>

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
and so we thought well let's
 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.050 align:start position:0%
and so we thought well let's
um

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.050 align:start position:0%
um
let's<00:06:48.720><c> let's</c><00:06:48.780><c> get</c><00:06:49.440><c> some</c><00:06:49.740><c> Partners</c><00:06:50.280><c> to</c><00:06:50.699><c> invest</c>

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
let's let's get some Partners to invest
 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.450 align:start position:0%
let's let's get some Partners to invest
in<00:06:51.300><c> us</c><00:06:51.479><c> because</c><00:06:51.720><c> they'll</c><00:06:52.020><c> be</c><00:06:52.259><c> strategic</c>

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
in us because they'll be strategic
 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.110 align:start position:0%
in us because they'll be strategic
and<00:06:54.360><c> so</c><00:06:54.780><c> we</c><00:06:55.080><c> we</c><00:06:55.440><c> looked</c><00:06:55.979><c> we</c><00:06:56.340><c> decided</c><00:06:56.759><c> that</c>

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
and so we we looked we decided that
 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.450 align:start position:0%
and so we we looked we decided that
since<00:06:57.780><c> we</c><00:06:57.960><c> had</c><00:06:58.199><c> we</c><00:06:58.680><c> were</c><00:06:58.800><c> going</c><00:06:59.039><c> to</c><00:06:59.100><c> start</c><00:06:59.280><c> out</c>

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
since we had we were going to start out
 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.890 align:start position:0%
since we had we were going to start out
on<00:06:59.580><c> the</c><00:06:59.759><c> workstation</c><00:07:00.120><c> we</c><00:07:00.419><c> were</c><00:07:00.539><c> going</c><00:07:00.660><c> to</c><00:07:00.780><c> go</c>

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
on the workstation we were going to go
 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
on the workstation we were going to go
into<00:07:01.080><c> the</c><00:07:01.440><c> server</c><00:07:01.740><c> once</c><00:07:02.100><c> we</c><00:07:02.160><c> got</c><00:07:02.340><c> into</c><00:07:02.520><c> the</c>

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
into the server once we got into the
 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.270 align:start position:0%
into the server once we got into the
server<00:07:03.240><c> that</c><00:07:03.600><c> would</c><00:07:03.840><c> be</c><00:07:04.500><c> a</c><00:07:04.680><c> really</c><00:07:04.860><c> difficult</c>

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
server that would be a really difficult
 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.450 align:start position:0%
server that would be a really difficult
Market<00:07:05.639><c> to</c><00:07:06.000><c> go</c><00:07:06.180><c> into</c><00:07:06.800><c> so</c><00:07:07.800><c> let's</c><00:07:08.039><c> get</c><00:07:08.280><c> the</c>

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
Market to go into so let's get the
 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.390 align:start position:0%
Market to go into so let's get the
hardware<00:07:08.580><c> vendors</c><00:07:09.240><c> to</c><00:07:09.660><c> invest</c><00:07:10.020><c> in</c><00:07:10.259><c> us</c><00:07:10.500><c> so</c><00:07:11.160><c> we</c>

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
hardware vendors to invest in us so we
 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.249 align:start position:0%
hardware vendors to invest in us so we
won<00:07:11.520><c> and</c><00:07:11.819><c> then</c><00:07:11.940><c> we</c><00:07:12.120><c> thought</c><00:07:12.240><c> well</c><00:07:12.479><c> it's</c><00:07:12.780><c> IBM</c>

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 align:start position:0%
won and then we thought well it's IBM
 

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:14.930 align:start position:0%
won and then we thought well it's IBM
Dell<00:07:13.620><c> or</c><00:07:13.740><c> HP</c>

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
Dell or HP
 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
Dell or HP
and<00:07:15.900><c> we</c><00:07:16.259><c> thought</c><00:07:16.440><c> IBM</c><00:07:17.039><c> and</c><00:07:17.280><c> HP</c><00:07:17.639><c> could</c><00:07:18.000><c> build</c>

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
and we thought IBM and HP could build
 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.909 align:start position:0%
and we thought IBM and HP could build
software<00:07:18.780><c> so</c><00:07:19.020><c> they</c><00:07:19.259><c> wouldn't</c><00:07:19.380><c> be</c><00:07:19.620><c> good</c>

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
software so they wouldn't be good
 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:22.430 align:start position:0%
software so they wouldn't be good
partners<00:07:20.520><c> in</c><00:07:20.880><c> the</c><00:07:21.000><c> long</c><00:07:21.180><c> term</c><00:07:21.360><c> perhaps</c><00:07:22.020><c> but</c>

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
partners in the long term perhaps but
 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.890 align:start position:0%
partners in the long term perhaps but
Dell<00:07:22.740><c> we</c><00:07:23.039><c> didn't</c><00:07:23.220><c> expect</c><00:07:23.520><c> today</c><00:07:24.180><c> they</c><00:07:24.539><c> do</c><00:07:24.660><c> do</c>

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
Dell we didn't expect today they do do
 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
Dell we didn't expect today they do do
software<00:07:25.259><c> but</c><00:07:25.560><c> back</c><00:07:25.740><c> then</c><00:07:25.919><c> there</c><00:07:26.280><c> was</c><00:07:26.460><c> uh</c><00:07:27.360><c> no</c>

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
software but back then there was uh no
 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:29.170 align:start position:0%
software but back then there was uh no
chance<00:07:27.780><c> they</c><00:07:28.080><c> were</c><00:07:28.259><c> going</c><00:07:28.380><c> to</c><00:07:28.500><c> do</c><00:07:28.620><c> software</c>

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.180 align:start position:0%
chance they were going to do software
 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.230 align:start position:0%
chance they were going to do software
and<00:07:30.180><c> so</c><00:07:30.479><c> we</c><00:07:30.720><c> went</c><00:07:31.020><c> to</c><00:07:31.199><c> Michael</c><00:07:32.099><c> delling</c><00:07:32.759><c> and</c>

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
and so we went to Michael delling and
 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.510 align:start position:0%
and so we went to Michael delling and
convinced<00:07:33.780><c> him</c><00:07:33.960><c> to</c><00:07:34.259><c> invest</c><00:07:34.620><c> in</c><00:07:34.860><c> us</c><00:07:35.099><c> and</c><00:07:35.340><c> take</c>

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
convinced him to invest in us and take
 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
convinced him to invest in us and take
the<00:07:35.759><c> lead</c><00:07:35.940><c> on</c><00:07:36.240><c> a</c><00:07:36.479><c> round</c><00:07:36.660><c> and</c>

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
the lead on a round and
 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.730 align:start position:0%
the lead on a round and
actually<00:07:39.479><c> we</c><00:07:39.720><c> were</c><00:07:39.900><c> going</c><00:07:40.139><c> through</c><00:07:40.440><c> that</c>

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
actually we were going through that
 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.570 align:start position:0%
actually we were going through that
round<00:07:40.979><c> this</c><00:07:41.460><c> was</c><00:07:41.639><c> in</c><00:07:42.000><c> 2000</c>

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:43.580 align:start position:0%
round this was in 2000
 

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.249 align:start position:0%
round this was in 2000
and<00:07:44.580><c> I</c><00:07:44.880><c> was</c><00:07:45.060><c> sort</c><00:07:45.240><c> of</c><00:07:45.360><c> the</c><00:07:45.479><c> height</c><00:07:45.720><c> of</c><00:07:45.960><c> the</c>

we had this x86 virtualization you know
it<00:10:21.420><c> would</c><00:10:21.540><c> be</c><00:10:21.720><c> a</c><00:10:21.959><c> really</c><00:10:22.080><c> great</c><00:10:22.440><c> way</c><00:10:22.740><c> for</c>

it would be a really great way for

using<00:10:27.180><c> Linux</c><00:10:27.600><c> back</c><00:10:27.899><c> then</c><00:10:28.080><c> it</c><00:10:28.380><c> was</c><00:10:28.560><c> just</c>

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
though and uh and so we would build a
 

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.570 align:start position:0%
though and uh and so we would build a
desktop<00:10:37.440><c> product</c><00:10:37.740><c> that</c><00:10:38.040><c> would</c><00:10:38.160><c> let</c><00:10:38.339><c> you</c><00:10:38.399><c> run</c>

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
desktop product that would let you run
 

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.170 align:start position:0%
desktop product that would let you run

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
Windows on Linux and uh that way we
 

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.090 align:start position:0%
Windows on Linux and uh that way we
would<00:10:42.360><c> we've</c><00:10:43.140><c> and</c>

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
would we've and
 

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.090 align:start position:0%
would we've and
um<00:10:44.279><c> we</c><00:10:44.820><c> could</c><00:10:44.940><c> also</c><00:10:45.300><c> let</c><00:10:45.839><c> Linux</c><00:10:46.440><c> run</c><00:10:46.740><c> on</c>

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
um we could also let Linux run on
 

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.670 align:start position:0%
um we could also let Linux run on
Windows<00:10:47.640><c> and</c><00:10:48.420><c> we</c><00:10:48.660><c> figured</c><00:10:48.959><c> that</c><00:10:49.200><c> way</c><00:10:49.320><c> we</c><00:10:49.560><c> could</c>

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
