um it tends to be initially I think the
 

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:04.030 align:start position:0%
um it tends to be initially I think the
Big<00:14:02.000><c> Driver</c><00:14:02.320><c> was</c><00:14:02.519><c> cost</c><00:14:03.079><c> like</c><00:14:03.240><c> open</c><00:14:03.519><c> AI</c><00:14:03.920><c> like</c>

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
Big Driver was cost like open AI like
 

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.870 align:start position:0%
Big Driver was cost like open AI like
chat<00:14:04.279><c> GPT</c><00:14:04.800><c> was</c><00:14:05.000><c> expensive</c><00:14:05.839><c> and</c><00:14:06.000><c> people</c><00:14:06.279><c> wanted</c>

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
chat GPT was expensive and people wanted
 

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.829 align:start position:0%

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
a um cheaper version of it and so I
 

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:11.629 align:start position:0%
a um cheaper version of it and so I
think<00:14:09.920><c> it</c><00:14:10.000><c> was</c><00:14:10.160><c> very</c><00:14:10.320><c> easy</c><00:14:10.560><c> to</c><00:14:10.720><c> get</c><00:14:10.959><c> customers</c>

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
think it was very easy to get customers

and they start sort of uh monetizing the
 

00:31:37.639 --> 00:31:39.909 align:start position:0%
and they start sort of uh monetizing the

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
and then the cycle returns and repeats
 

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.590 align:start position:0%
and then the cycle returns and repeats
so<00:31:43.519><c> that's</c><00:31:43.720><c> why</c><00:31:43.840><c> I</c><00:31:43.960><c> like</c><00:31:44.159><c> being</c><00:31:44.360><c> at</c><00:31:44.480><c> the</c>
