00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I would not say it's a bad idea but
 

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.930 align:start position:0%
yeah I would not say it's a bad idea but
that's<00:09:51.020><c> not</c><00:09:51.260><c> gonna</c><00:09:51.500><c> generate</c><00:09:51.980><c> enormous</c>

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:52.940 align:start position:0%
that's not gonna generate enormous
 

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's not gonna generate enormous
returns<00:09:53.360><c> and</c><00:09:53.870><c> so</c><00:09:54.170><c> it</c><00:09:55.130><c> might</c><00:09:55.250><c> be</c><00:09:55.310><c> a</c><00:09:55.430><c> great</c>

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:55.610 align:start position:0%

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.150 align:start position:0%
returns and so it might be a great
investment<00:09:55.850><c> for</c><00:09:56.060><c> some</c><00:09:56.330><c> people</c><00:09:56.630><c> I</c><00:09:57.170><c> just</c><00:09:57.650><c> it's</c>

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
investment for some people I just it's
 

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.860 align:start position:0%
investment for some people I just it's
not<00:09:58.310><c> a</c><00:09:58.370><c> great</c><00:09:58.610><c> investment</c><00:09:58.940><c> for</c><00:09:59.270><c> me</c><00:09:59.600><c> and</c><00:09:59.750><c> it</c>

00:09:59.860 --> 00:09:59.870 align:start position:0%
not a great investment for me and it
 

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.500 align:start position:0%
not a great investment for me and it
generally<00:10:00.200><c> doesn't</c><00:10:00.410><c> fit</c><00:10:00.800><c> the</c><00:10:01.180><c> you</c><00:10:02.180><c> know</c><00:10:02.300><c> fit</c>

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
strategy I think that every everything
 

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.950 align:start position:0%
strategy I think that every everything
is<00:38:07.850><c> on</c><00:38:07.970><c> a</c><00:38:08.000><c> case-by-case</c><00:38:08.240><c> basis</c><00:38:09.580><c> you</c><00:38:10.580><c> know</c>

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
is on a case-by-case basis you know
 

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.150 align:start position:0%
is on a case-by-case basis you know
generally<00:38:11.960><c> speaking</c><00:38:12.320><c> there's</c><00:38:12.530><c> not</c><00:38:12.770><c> a</c><00:38:12.800><c> lot</c><00:38:13.130><c> of</c>

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
generally speaking there's not a lot of
 

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
generally speaking there's not a lot of

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:15.170 align:start position:0%

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:16.580 align:start position:0%
make it an investment and then you
 

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
