let's start like Basics and high level

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 align:start position:0%
like what is a large language model and

like what is a large language model and

sometimes<00:03:19.379><c> it's</c><00:03:19.620><c> so</c><00:03:19.920><c> good</c><00:03:20.040><c> that</c><00:03:20.280><c> you</c><00:03:20.400><c> cannot</c>

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's so good that you cannot

sometimes it's so good that you cannot

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 align:start position:0%
able to do that and then just
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.149 align:start position:0%
able to do that and then just
occasionally<00:03:23.819><c> it's</c><00:03:24.720><c> horrendously</c><00:03:25.500><c> wrong</c><00:03:25.680><c> and</c>

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
occasionally it's horrendously wrong and
 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:27.530 align:start position:0%
occasionally it's horrendously wrong and
that's<00:03:26.280><c> just</c><00:03:26.519><c> to</c><00:03:26.640><c> do</c><00:03:26.760><c> with</c><00:03:26.879><c> how</c><00:03:27.060><c> the</c><00:03:27.180><c> model</c><00:03:27.300><c> is</c>

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's just to do with how the model is
 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.210 align:start position:0%
that's just to do with how the model is
originally<00:03:27.840><c> trained</c><00:03:28.319><c> they're</c><00:03:28.739><c> trained</c><00:03:29.040><c> to</c><00:03:29.099><c> do</c>

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 align:start position:0%

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.130 align:start position:0%

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
an expert prediction and so they don't
 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.630 align:start position:0%
an expert prediction and so they don't

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
uh dishonest yeah sometimes they get it
 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.690 align:start position:0%

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
wrong sometimes they get it wrong but
 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.610 align:start position:0%

the<00:03:35.879><c> danger</c><00:03:36.120><c> is</c><00:03:36.360><c> that</c><00:03:36.599><c> they</c><00:03:36.780><c> they</c><00:03:37.019><c> confidently</c>

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
the danger is that they they confidently
 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.369 align:start position:0%
the danger is that they they confidently
get<00:03:37.739><c> it</c><00:03:37.920><c> wrong</c><00:03:38.099><c> so</c><00:03:38.580><c> uh</c><00:03:39.360><c> and</c><00:03:39.599><c> very</c><00:03:39.780><c> persuasively</c>

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 align:start position:0%
get it wrong so uh and very persuasively
 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.170 align:start position:0%
get it wrong so uh and very persuasively
you<00:03:40.799><c> know</c><00:03:40.860><c> very</c><00:03:41.159><c> authoritatively</c><00:03:41.819><c> they</c><00:03:42.000><c> get</c>

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
you know very authoritatively they get
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.550 align:start position:0%
you know very authoritatively they get
it<00:03:42.239><c> wrong</c><00:03:42.420><c> and</c><00:03:42.659><c> so</c><00:03:42.780><c> people</c><00:03:42.959><c> might</c><00:03:43.200><c> you</c><00:03:43.440><c> know</c>

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
it wrong and so people might you know
 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.710 align:start position:0%
it wrong and so people might you know
mistakenly<00:03:44.040><c> trust</c><00:03:44.340><c> these</c><00:03:44.640><c> models</c>

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
mistakenly trust these models
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.910 align:start position:0%
mistakenly trust these models
um<00:03:45.780><c> so</c><00:03:45.900><c> there's</c><00:03:46.080><c> a</c><00:03:46.200><c> couple</c><00:03:46.260><c> of</c><00:03:46.379><c> ways</c><00:03:46.620><c> that</c><00:03:46.739><c> you</c>

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so there's a couple of ways that you

suspect<00:11:22.260><c> that</c><00:11:22.440><c> developers</c><00:11:22.980><c> will</c><00:11:23.339><c> actually</c><00:11:23.519><c> be</c>

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:23.700 align:start position:0%
suspect that developers will actually be
 

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.009 align:start position:0%
suspect that developers will actually be
one<00:11:23.820><c> of</c><00:11:23.940><c> the</c><00:11:24.000><c> first</c><00:11:24.180><c> jobs</c><00:11:24.420><c> to</c><00:11:24.660><c> see</c><00:11:24.839><c> large</c>

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
one of the first jobs to see large
 

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:26.329 align:start position:0%
one of the first jobs to see large

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
fractions of their job be automated
 

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:29.210 align:start position:0%
fractions of their job be automated
which<00:11:26.940><c> I</c><00:11:27.060><c> think</c><00:11:27.120><c> is</c><00:11:27.240><c> very</c><00:11:27.420><c> counter-intuitive</c>

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
which I think is very counter-intuitive
 

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.069 align:start position:0%
which I think is very counter-intuitive
um but<00:11:30.060><c> also</c><00:11:30.300><c> predicting</c><00:11:30.600><c> the</c><00:11:30.720><c> future</c><00:11:30.839><c> is</c>

00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
um but also predicting the future is
 

00:11:31.079 --> 00:11:33.410 align:start position:0%
um but also predicting the future is
hard<00:11:31.320><c> so</c><00:11:31.740><c> yeah</c><00:11:32.459><c> what</c><00:11:32.880><c> do</c><00:11:33.000><c> you</c><00:11:33.060><c> think</c><00:11:33.180><c> the</c><00:11:33.300><c> next</c>

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
hard so yeah what do you think the next
 

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.210 align:start position:0%
hard so yeah what do you think the next
breakthroughs<00:11:33.899><c> will</c><00:11:34.079><c> be</c><00:11:34.200><c> in</c><00:11:34.440><c> llm</c><00:11:34.920><c> technology</c>

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
breakthroughs will be in llm technology
 

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.370 align:start position:0%
breakthroughs will be in llm technology
ah<00:11:35.820><c> so</c><00:11:35.940><c> I</c><00:11:36.120><c> actually</c><00:11:36.240><c> think</c><00:11:36.480><c> here</c><00:11:36.720><c> the</c><00:11:36.959><c> roadmap</c>

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
ah so I actually think here the roadmap
 

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.389 align:start position:0%
ah so I actually think here the roadmap
is<00:11:37.560><c> like</c>

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
is like
 

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.190 align:start position:0%
is like
quite<00:11:38.940><c> well</c><00:11:39.060><c> known</c><00:11:39.300><c> almost</c><00:11:39.600><c> like</c><00:11:39.899><c> I</c><00:11:40.079><c> think</c>

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
quite well known almost like I think
 

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.329 align:start position:0%
quite well known almost like I think
there's<00:11:40.380><c> a</c><00:11:40.560><c> bunch</c><00:11:40.680><c> of</c><00:11:40.860><c> things</c><00:11:41.040><c> that</c><00:11:41.220><c> are</c>

00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of things that are
 

00:11:41.339 --> 00:11:43.790 align:start position:0%
there's a bunch of things that are
coming<00:11:41.519><c> that</c><00:11:41.940><c> we</c><00:11:42.180><c> are</c><00:11:42.839><c> kind</c><00:11:43.019><c> of</c><00:11:43.079><c> baked</c><00:11:43.440><c> in</c><00:11:43.560><c> we</c>

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
coming that we are kind of baked in we
 

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.290 align:start position:0%
coming that we are kind of baked in we
know<00:11:43.920><c> they're</c><00:11:44.160><c> coming</c><00:11:44.399><c> we</c><00:11:44.760><c> just</c><00:11:44.880><c> have</c><00:11:45.060><c> to</c><00:11:45.180><c> wait</c>

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
know they're coming we just have to wait
 

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.910 align:start position:0%
know they're coming we just have to wait
for<00:11:45.480><c> it</c><00:11:45.600><c> to</c><00:11:45.720><c> be</c><00:11:45.839><c> achieved</c><00:11:46.140><c> one</c><00:11:46.560><c> thing</c><00:11:46.680><c> that</c><00:11:46.800><c> I</c>

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
for it to be achieved one thing that I
 

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.350 align:start position:0%
for it to be achieved one thing that I
think<00:11:47.040><c> developers</c><00:11:47.519><c> will</c><00:11:47.760><c> really</c><00:11:47.940><c> care</c><00:11:48.180><c> about</c>

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
think developers will really care about
 

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.630 align:start position:0%
think developers will really care about
is<00:11:48.959><c> the</c><00:11:49.200><c> context</c><00:11:49.500><c> window</c><00:11:49.740><c> so</c><00:11:50.100><c> at</c><00:11:50.279><c> the</c><00:11:50.399><c> moment</c>

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
is the context window so at the moment
 

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
is the context window so at the moment
when<00:11:51.420><c> you</c><00:11:51.540><c> sort</c><00:11:51.779><c> of</c><00:11:51.839><c> use</c><00:11:51.959><c> these</c><00:11:52.260><c> models</c><00:11:52.500><c> as</c><00:11:52.680><c> a</c>

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
when you sort of use these models as a

00:11:56.329 --> 00:11:56.339 align:start position:0%
feed it every time you use it and
 

00:11:56.339 --> 00:11:58.190 align:start position:0%
feed it every time you use it and

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
extending that context window is going
 

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.569 align:start position:0%
extending that context window is going

00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
to add a lot more capabilities one thing
 

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:01.490 align:start position:0%
to add a lot more capabilities one thing
that<00:11:59.760><c> I'm</c><00:11:59.940><c> really</c><00:12:00.120><c> excited</c><00:12:00.420><c> about</c><00:12:00.600><c> is</c>

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
that I'm really excited about is
 

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.110 align:start position:0%
that I'm really excited about is
actually<00:12:01.680><c> augmenting</c><00:12:02.459><c> large</c><00:12:02.880><c> language</c>

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
actually augmenting large language
 

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.970 align:start position:0%
actually augmenting large language
models<00:12:03.600><c> with</c><00:12:03.720><c> the</c><00:12:03.839><c> ability</c><00:12:04.019><c> to</c><00:12:04.200><c> take</c><00:12:04.380><c> actions</c>

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
models with the ability to take actions
 

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.590 align:start position:0%
models with the ability to take actions
and<00:12:05.399><c> so</c><00:12:05.519><c> we've</c><00:12:05.700><c> seen</c><00:12:05.820><c> a</c><00:12:05.940><c> few</c><00:12:06.060><c> examples</c><00:12:06.300><c> of</c><00:12:06.480><c> this</c>

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
and so we've seen a few examples of this
 

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.389 align:start position:0%
and so we've seen a few examples of this
that's<00:12:06.779><c> a</c><00:12:07.019><c> startup</c><00:12:07.200><c> called</c><00:12:07.380><c> Adept</c><00:12:07.920><c> AI</c><00:12:08.160><c> that</c>

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's a startup called Adept AI that
 

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:10.910 align:start position:0%
that's a startup called Adept AI that

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
are doing this and a few others where
 

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.290 align:start position:0%
are doing this and a few others where
you<00:12:11.100><c> essentially</c><00:12:11.399><c> let</c><00:12:11.760><c> the</c><00:12:11.940><c> large</c><00:12:12.060><c> language</c>

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
you essentially let the large language
 

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.389 align:start position:0%
you essentially let the large language
model<00:12:12.600><c> decide</c><00:12:13.140><c> to</c><00:12:13.380><c> take</c><00:12:13.500><c> some</c><00:12:13.740><c> tasks</c><00:12:14.100><c> so</c><00:12:14.220><c> it</c>

yeah thousands and thousands of apps get
 

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.389 align:start position:0%
yeah thousands and thousands of apps get

built then the lead they have in terms

00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:57.899 align:start position:0%

00:14:57.899 --> 00:14:59.509 align:start position:0%
of feedback data would seem to be pretty

00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
compelling so I think the feedback data
 

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:01.730 align:start position:0%
compelling so I think the feedback data
is<00:14:59.639><c> great</c><00:15:00.000><c> for</c><00:15:00.480><c> narrower</c><00:15:01.019><c> applications</c><00:15:01.500><c> right</c>

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:01.740 align:start position:0%
is great for narrower applications right
 

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.110 align:start position:0%
is great for narrower applications right
like<00:15:01.920><c> if</c><00:15:02.100><c> you're</c><00:15:02.220><c> building</c><00:15:02.459><c> an</c><00:15:02.639><c> end</c><00:15:02.760><c> user</c>

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
like if you're building an end user
 

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.970 align:start position:0%
like if you're building an end user
application<00:15:03.600><c> then</c><00:15:04.139><c> I</c><00:15:04.320><c> think</c><00:15:04.440><c> you</c><00:15:04.620><c> can</c><00:15:04.740><c> get</c><00:15:04.860><c> a</c>

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
application then I think you can get a
 

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.350 align:start position:0%
application then I think you can get a
lot<00:15:05.040><c> of</c><00:15:05.160><c> differentiation</c><00:15:05.699><c> through</c><00:15:06.000><c> feedback</c>

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%

um<00:15:11.699><c> and</c><00:15:12.000><c> so</c><00:15:12.240><c> they</c><00:15:12.839><c> can't</c><00:15:13.079><c> kind</c><00:15:13.320><c> of</c><00:15:13.380><c> like</c><00:15:13.500><c> let</c><00:15:13.860><c> it</c>

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.470 align:start position:0%
