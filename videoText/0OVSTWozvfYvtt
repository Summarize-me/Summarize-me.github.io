i would argue it's easy to calculate but

i would argue it's easy to calculate but
it's<00:02:24.879><c> just</c><00:02:25.120><c> nice</c><00:02:25.360><c> to</c><00:02:25.440><c> have</c><00:02:25.680><c> a</c><00:02:25.840><c> tool</c><00:02:26.239><c> there</c>

so
 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.910 align:start position:0%

i think that with this concept of

what's so weird is how obvious it is
 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.350 align:start position:0%
what's so weird is how obvious it is

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
like it's weirdly the kind of concept
 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.430 align:start position:0%
like it's weirdly the kind of concept

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
that most fundraisers succeed so you're
 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
that most fundraisers succeed so you're

than that
 

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.909 align:start position:0%
than that
so<00:25:50.400><c> at</c><00:25:50.559><c> any</c><00:25:50.720><c> given</c><00:25:51.039><c> time</c><00:25:51.279><c> in</c><00:25:51.360><c> your</c><00:25:51.520><c> startup</c>

00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
so at any given time in your startup
 

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.750 align:start position:0%
so at any given time in your startup
you're<00:25:52.080><c> being</c><00:25:52.320><c> judged</c><00:25:52.720><c> on</c><00:25:52.799><c> the</c><00:25:52.880><c> last</c><00:25:53.279><c> six</c><00:25:53.520><c> to</c>

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're being judged on the last six to
 

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.029 align:start position:0%
you're being judged on the last six to
18<00:25:54.400><c> months</c>

00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
18 months
 

00:25:57.039 --> 00:26:00.070 align:start position:0%
18 months
and<00:25:57.279><c> so</c><00:25:57.760><c> if</c><00:25:58.000><c> you</c><00:25:58.240><c> take</c><00:25:58.559><c> this</c><00:25:58.799><c> hit</c><00:25:59.520><c> you</c><00:25:59.760><c> cut</c><00:25:59.919><c> your</c>

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
and so if you take this hit you cut your
 

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.149 align:start position:0%
and so if you take this hit you cut your
revenue<00:26:00.480><c> in</c><00:26:00.640><c> half</c><00:26:00.960><c> but</c><00:26:01.120><c> you</c><00:26:01.279><c> get</c><00:26:01.520><c> to</c><00:26:01.760><c> default</c>

00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
revenue in half but you get to default
 

00:26:02.159 --> 00:26:03.510 align:start position:0%
revenue in half but you get to default
to<00:26:02.320><c> live</c>

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
to live
 

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.190 align:start position:0%
to live
and<00:26:03.760><c> the</c><00:26:03.840><c> result</c><00:26:04.320><c> of</c><00:26:04.400><c> that</c><00:26:04.640><c> is</c><00:26:04.720><c> you</c><00:26:04.880><c> get</c><00:26:05.039><c> to</c>

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
and the result of that is you get to
 

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.149 align:start position:0%
