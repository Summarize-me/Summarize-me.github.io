00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
I think the real subtlety I'm sort of a
 

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.630 align:start position:0%
I think the real subtlety I'm sort of a

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.270 align:start position:0%

because<00:17:58.200><c> what</c><00:17:58.320><c> it</c><00:17:58.520><c> really</c><00:17:58.880><c> what</c><00:17:59.039><c> really</c>

00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
because what it really what really
 

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.390 align:start position:0%
because what it really what really
matters<00:17:59.880><c> is</c><00:18:00.120><c> actually</c><00:18:00.600><c> the</c><00:18:01.120><c> um</c><00:18:01.360><c> gross</c><00:18:01.720><c> margin</c>

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
matters is actually the um gross margin
 

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.789 align:start position:0%
matters is actually the um gross margin

00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
so if you look at a paler for instance
 

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:08.390 align:start position:0%
so if you look at a paler for instance
you<00:18:04.960><c> can</c><00:18:05.240><c> have</c><00:18:05.760><c> a</c><00:18:05.960><c> 90%</c><00:18:06.919><c> gross</c><00:18:07.200><c> margin</c><00:18:07.559><c> or</c><00:18:07.720><c> 80%</c>

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
you can have a 90% gross margin or 80%
 

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.070 align:start position:0%
you can have a 90% gross margin or 80%

there<00:25:44.760><c> was</c><00:25:44.919><c> no</c><00:25:45.120><c> hype</c><00:25:45.399><c> around</c><00:25:45.679><c> crypto</c><00:25:46.039><c> it</c><00:25:46.159><c> was</c>

00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
there was no hype around crypto it was
 

00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
there was no hype around crypto it was

not seen as a very fundable thing and
 

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.830 align:start position:0%
not seen as a very fundable thing and
then<00:25:48.880><c> what</c><00:25:49.120><c> happened</c><00:25:49.799><c> is</c><00:25:50.000><c> crypto</c><00:25:50.360><c> will</c><00:25:50.520><c> go</c><00:25:50.679><c> on</c>

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
then what happened is crypto will go on
 

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.149 align:start position:0%
then what happened is crypto will go on
these<00:25:51.000><c> bull</c><00:25:51.320><c> runs</c><00:25:52.080><c> and</c><00:25:52.520><c> when</c><00:25:52.679><c> there's</c><00:25:52.840><c> like</c><00:25:52.960><c> a</c>

00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
these bull runs and when there's like a

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin so when the price of Bitcoin
 

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.950 align:start position:0%

tends<00:25:56.960><c> to</c><00:25:57.159><c> go</c><00:25:57.279><c> on</c><00:25:57.480><c> these</c><00:25:57.679><c> sort</c><00:25:57.799><c> of</c><00:25:57.919><c> like</c><00:25:58.320><c> eoric</c>

00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
tends to go on these sort of like eoric
 

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.190 align:start position:0%

like pumps and anytime that happens it
 

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.029 align:start position:0%

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
brings lots of people into crypto and I
 

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:05.870 align:start position:0%
brings lots of people into crypto and I
think<00:26:04.159><c> at</c><00:26:04.360><c> YC</c><00:26:04.760><c> what</c><00:26:04.840><c> we</c><00:26:04.960><c> would</c><00:26:05.080><c> see</c><00:26:05.360><c> is</c><00:26:05.559><c> like</c><00:26:05.799><c> it</c>

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
think at YC what we would see is like it
 

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.789 align:start position:0%
think at YC what we would see is like it
would<00:26:06.039><c> bring</c><00:26:06.200><c> in</c><00:26:06.399><c> lots</c><00:26:06.600><c> of</c><00:26:06.720><c> people</c><00:26:07.399><c> applying</c>
