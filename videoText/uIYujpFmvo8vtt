what works kind of to your point earlier
 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.010 align:start position:0%
what works kind of to your point earlier
is<00:07:03.360><c> to</c><00:07:03.660><c> actually</c><00:07:03.900><c> focus</c><00:07:04.500><c> on</c><00:07:05.539><c> very</c><00:07:06.539><c> specific</c>

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
is to actually focus on very specific
 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.230 align:start position:0%
is to actually focus on very specific

and use that to get people into the

and use that to get people into the
product<00:07:11.160><c> and</c><00:07:11.400><c> then</c><00:07:11.520><c> they</c><00:07:11.699><c> can</c><00:07:11.759><c> say</c><00:07:11.940><c> oh</c><00:07:12.060><c> there's</c>

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
product and then they can say oh there's
 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.670 align:start position:0%
product and then they can say oh there's
actually<00:07:12.479><c> much</c><00:07:12.720><c> more</c><00:07:12.960><c> that</c><00:07:13.080><c> I</c><00:07:13.259><c> can</c><00:07:13.380><c> do</c><00:07:13.500><c> here</c>

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
actually much more that I can do here
 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.770 align:start position:0%
actually much more that I can do here
too<00:07:13.919><c> so</c><00:07:14.639><c> it</c><00:07:14.759><c> seems</c><00:07:15.000><c> like</c><00:07:15.060><c> maybe</c><00:07:15.240><c> the</c><00:07:15.479><c> use</c><00:07:15.600><c> case</c>

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
too so it seems like maybe the use case
 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.330 align:start position:0%
too so it seems like maybe the use case
they're<00:07:16.020><c> trying</c><00:07:16.259><c> to</c><00:07:16.380><c> Target</c><00:07:16.500><c> there</c><00:07:16.800><c> is</c><00:07:17.039><c> is</c>

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
they're trying to Target there is is
 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.730 align:start position:0%
they're trying to Target there is is
image<00:07:17.940><c> customization</c><00:07:18.720><c> and</c><00:07:19.380><c> maybe</c><00:07:19.500><c> it</c><00:07:19.620><c> does</c>

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
image customization and maybe it does
 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.770 align:start position:0%
image customization and maybe it does
more<00:07:19.860><c> than</c><00:07:19.979><c> that</c><00:07:20.160><c> I</c><00:07:20.340><c> don't</c><00:07:20.460><c> know</c><00:07:20.520><c> okay</c><00:07:21.180><c> how</c><00:07:21.660><c> it</c>

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
more than that I don't know okay how it
 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.809 align:start position:0%
more than that I don't know okay how it

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:23.819 align:start position:0%

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
how it works very early because it
 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.890 align:start position:0%

all<00:10:54.420><c> right</c><00:10:54.600><c> so</c><00:10:55.140><c> what</c><00:10:55.320><c> do</c><00:10:55.440><c> we</c><00:10:55.440><c> got</c><00:10:55.620><c> going</c><00:10:55.740><c> on</c><00:10:55.860><c> in</c>

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
all right so what do we got going on in
 

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.410 align:start position:0%
all right so what do we got going on in
this<00:10:56.160><c> video</c><00:10:56.399><c> here</c>

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
this video here
 

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.269 align:start position:0%
this video here
it's<00:10:57.540><c> pulling</c><00:10:57.899><c> out</c><00:10:58.019><c> people</c><00:10:58.200><c> and</c><00:10:58.620><c> faces</c><00:10:59.100><c> I</c>

00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's pulling out people and faces I
 

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:01.610 align:start position:0%
it's pulling out people and faces I
guess<00:10:59.459><c> yeah</c><00:11:00.240><c> this</c><00:11:00.540><c> makes</c><00:11:00.720><c> me</c><00:11:00.899><c> think</c><00:11:01.140><c> this</c><00:11:01.440><c> is</c>

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
guess yeah this makes me think this is
 

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.329 align:start position:0%
guess yeah this makes me think this is
like<00:11:01.980><c> software</c><00:11:02.579><c> for</c><00:11:03.060><c> like</c><00:11:03.480><c> closed</c><00:11:03.839><c> circuit</c>

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:04.339 align:start position:0%
like software for like closed circuit
 

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:07.310 align:start position:0%
like software for like closed circuit
cameras<00:11:05.339><c> right</c><00:11:06.000><c> like</c><00:11:06.540><c> to</c><00:11:06.959><c> find</c><00:11:07.140><c> people</c>

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
cameras right like to find people
 

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.050 align:start position:0%
cameras right like to find people

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
walking through the airport or something
 

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.569 align:start position:0%
walking through the airport or something
like<00:11:09.300><c> that</c><00:11:09.420><c> but</c><00:11:09.600><c> it</c><00:11:09.720><c> talks</c><00:11:09.959><c> about</c><00:11:10.019><c> deep</c><00:11:10.320><c> fakes</c>

00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
like that but it talks about deep fakes
 

00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:13.130 align:start position:0%
like that but it talks about deep fakes
so<00:11:12.060><c> it</c><00:11:12.180><c> seems</c><00:11:12.420><c> like</c><00:11:12.480><c> maybe</c><00:11:12.600><c> that's</c><00:11:12.899><c> not</c>

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
so it seems like maybe that's not
 

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:14.329 align:start position:0%
so it seems like maybe that's not
actually<00:11:13.440><c> what's</c><00:11:13.680><c> happening</c><00:11:13.980><c> here</c><00:11:14.100><c> that's</c>

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.339 align:start position:0%
actually what's happening here that's
 

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:15.290 align:start position:0%
actually what's happening here that's
right

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
right
 

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
right
and<00:11:15.899><c> there's</c><00:11:16.079><c> really</c><00:11:16.260><c> too</c><00:11:16.500><c> much</c><00:11:16.620><c> spacing</c>

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
and there's really too much spacing
 

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.650 align:start position:0%
and there's really too much spacing
between<00:11:17.279><c> them</c><00:11:17.640><c> between</c><00:11:17.940><c> the</c><00:11:18.180><c> lines</c><00:11:18.360><c> of</c><00:11:18.540><c> this</c>

00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%

think I subconsciously do this and maybe
 

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.449 align:start position:0%
think I subconsciously do this and maybe
this<00:11:36.540><c> is</c><00:11:36.660><c> a</c><00:11:36.779><c> designer</c><00:11:37.260><c> thing</c><00:11:37.440><c> but</c><00:11:37.860><c> it's</c>

this<00:13:15.899><c> is</c><00:13:15.959><c> almost</c><00:13:16.200><c> a</c><00:13:16.380><c> one</c><00:13:16.500><c> two</c><00:13:16.680><c> three</c><00:13:16.860><c> maybe</c>

um<00:17:15.240><c> maybe</c><00:17:15.720><c> potentially</c><00:17:16.199><c> overused</c>

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
um maybe potentially overused
 

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.730 align:start position:0%
um maybe potentially overused
a<00:17:18.179><c> lot</c><00:17:18.299><c> of</c><00:17:18.419><c> times</c><00:17:18.480><c> animation</c><00:17:19.140><c> can</c><00:17:19.439><c> be</c><00:17:19.559><c> used</c>

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of times animation can be used
 

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
a lot of times animation can be used
effectively<00:17:20.280><c> to</c><00:17:20.520><c> drop</c><00:17:20.760><c> the</c><00:17:21.540><c> user's</c><00:17:21.900><c> eye</c><00:17:22.020><c> to</c>

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
effectively to drop the user's eye to
 

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.230 align:start position:0%
effectively to drop the user's eye to
something<00:17:22.559><c> and</c><00:17:23.280><c> if</c><00:17:23.520><c> a</c><00:17:23.760><c> lot</c><00:17:23.819><c> of</c><00:17:23.939><c> things</c><00:17:24.059><c> are</c>

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
something and if a lot of things are
 

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.270 align:start position:0%
something and if a lot of things are
moving<00:17:24.600><c> then</c><00:17:24.900><c> it</c><00:17:25.140><c> just</c><00:17:25.260><c> becomes</c><00:17:25.740><c> kind</c><00:17:26.160><c> of</c>

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
moving then it just becomes kind of
