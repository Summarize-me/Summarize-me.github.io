interest<00:02:11.800><c> rates</c><00:02:12.400><c> everyone</c><00:02:12.760><c> had</c><00:02:12.879><c> to</c><00:02:13.280><c> and</c><00:02:13.360><c> so</c>

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
interest rates everyone had to and so
 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.990 align:start position:0%

they dumped it into stuff like mortgages
this<00:02:15.120><c> is</c><00:02:15.239><c> why</c><00:02:15.360><c> mortgage</c><00:02:15.720><c> interest</c><00:02:16.080><c> rates</c><00:02:16.280><c> were</c>

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
think about this right like the this is
 

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.269 align:start position:0%
think about this right like the this is
not<00:10:07.120><c> going</c><00:10:07.200><c> to</c><00:10:07.480><c> last</c><00:10:08.320><c> yeah</c><00:10:08.519><c> I</c><00:10:08.600><c> mean</c><00:10:08.920><c> for</c><00:10:09.120><c> what</c>

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
not going to last yeah I mean for what
 

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
not going to last yeah I mean for what
it's<00:10:09.440><c> worth</c><00:10:09.880><c> you</c><00:10:10.000><c> know</c><00:10:10.800><c> uh</c><00:10:11.000><c> if</c><00:10:11.560><c> Founders</c><00:10:11.920><c> that</c>

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's worth you know uh if Founders that
 

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
it's worth you know uh if Founders that
were<00:10:12.120><c> in</c><00:10:12.160><c> The</c><00:10:12.240><c> Bachelor</c><00:10:12.600><c> in</c><00:10:12.760><c> those</c><00:10:12.959><c> times</c><00:10:13.160><c> or</c>

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
probably back us up here but we were
 

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.790 align:start position:0%
probably back us up here but we were

it works in bad economic complement so
 

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.029 align:start position:0%
it works in bad economic complement so
when<00:17:43.039><c> times</c><00:17:43.200><c> are</c><00:17:43.400><c> good</c><00:17:43.559><c> it's</c><00:17:43.720><c> even</c><00:17:43.960><c> better</c><00:17:44.600><c> yep</c>

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
when times are good it's even better yep
 

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:46.990 align:start position:0%
when times are good it's even better yep
so<00:17:45.240><c> there</c><00:17:45.320><c> you</c><00:17:45.480><c> go</c><00:17:45.679><c> so</c><00:17:45.840><c> that's</c><00:17:46.000><c> zerp</c><00:17:46.679><c> zero</c>

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
