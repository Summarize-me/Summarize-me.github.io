00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:23.850 align:start position:0%
into dilution too so
 

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.419 align:start position:0%
into dilution too so
you<00:25:24.059><c> have</c><00:25:24.240><c> to</c><00:25:24.360><c> figure</c><00:25:24.539><c> that</c><00:25:24.750><c> out</c><00:25:24.809><c> and</c><00:25:25.200><c> there</c><00:25:26.130><c> we</c>

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
could even get away with not even
 

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
could even get away with not even

negotiating a valuation with your
 

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.990 align:start position:0%
negotiating a valuation with your
investors<00:25:38.820><c> and</c><00:25:39.120><c> you</c><00:25:39.210><c> could</c><00:25:39.360><c> try</c><00:25:39.510><c> it</c><00:25:39.539><c> that</c><00:25:39.780><c> way</c>

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
investors and you could try it that way
 

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.460 align:start position:0%
investors and you could try it that way
so<00:25:42.000><c> then</c><00:25:42.150><c> so</c><00:25:42.419><c> that's</c><00:25:42.600><c> an</c><00:25:42.750><c> option</c><00:25:42.900><c> but</c><00:25:43.289><c> freely</c>

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:43.470 align:start position:0%
so then so that's an option but freely
 

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.419 align:start position:0%
so then so that's an option but freely
that's<00:25:43.740><c> the</c><00:25:43.860><c> only</c><00:25:44.010><c> thing</c><00:25:44.160><c> you</c><00:25:44.250><c> need</c><00:25:44.370><c> to</c>

00:25:44.419 --> 00:25:44.429 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing you need to
 

00:25:44.429 --> 00:25:45.890 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing you need to
negotiate<00:25:44.580><c> and</c><00:25:45.030><c> like</c><00:25:45.120><c> I</c><00:25:45.210><c> said</c><00:25:45.390><c> no</c><00:25:45.570><c> lawyers</c>

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
negotiate and like I said no lawyers
 

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate and like I said no lawyers

00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.010 align:start position:0%
because what do you need them for okay
 

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:02.210 align:start position:0%
because what do you need them for okay
so<00:25:59.039><c> so</c><00:25:59.549><c> this</c><00:26:00.419><c> person's</c><00:26:00.900><c> investor</c><00:26:01.830><c> is</c><00:26:01.980><c> saying</c>

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
so so this person's investor is saying
 

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.210 align:start position:0%
so so this person's investor is saying
let's<00:26:02.429><c> add</c><00:26:02.610><c> something</c><00:26:02.970><c> to</c><00:26:03.210><c> the</c><00:26:03.330><c> safe</c><00:26:03.570><c> that</c>

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:04.220 align:start position:0%
let's add something to the safe that
 

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.830 align:start position:0%
let's add something to the safe that
that<00:26:05.220><c> will</c><00:26:05.400><c> address</c><00:26:05.789><c> the</c><00:26:06.000><c> issue</c><00:26:06.179><c> of</c><00:26:06.390><c> what</c><00:26:06.720><c> if</c>

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
that will address the issue of what if
 

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
that will address the issue of what if
