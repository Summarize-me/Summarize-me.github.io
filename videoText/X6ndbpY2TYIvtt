00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
that it's useful so we have the

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 align:start position:0%

give it so one of the big challenges for
 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.219 align:start position:0%
give it so one of the big challenges for
these<00:05:46.210><c> things</c><00:05:46.360><c> is</c><00:05:46.479><c> that</c><00:05:46.570><c> they</c><00:05:46.690><c> need</c><00:05:46.840><c> a</c><00:05:46.870><c> ton</c><00:05:47.200><c> of</c>

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 align:start position:0%
these things is that they need a ton of

these things is that they need a ton of

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 align:start position:0%
