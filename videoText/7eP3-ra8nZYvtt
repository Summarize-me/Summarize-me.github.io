00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
happens is that the way that they do

the stage
 

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.149 align:start position:0%
the stage
um<00:18:56.080><c> so</c><00:18:56.520><c> this</c><00:18:56.720><c> journey</c><00:18:57.320><c> has</c><00:18:57.520><c> been</c><00:18:58.440><c> kind</c><00:18:58.600><c> of</c>

00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
um so this journey has been kind of
 

00:18:59.159 --> 00:18:59.950 align:start position:0%
um so this journey has been kind of
really

00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
really
 

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.390 align:start position:0%
really
crazy<00:19:01.080><c> um</c><00:19:02.080><c> there's</c><00:19:02.320><c> this</c><00:19:03.039><c> phrase</c><00:19:04.039><c> which</c><00:19:04.159><c> is</c><00:19:04.240><c> a</c>

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
crazy um there's this phrase which is a
 

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.149 align:start position:0%
crazy um there's this phrase which is a
gross<00:19:05.000><c> underestimation</c><00:19:05.880><c> of</c><00:19:06.240><c> what</c><00:19:06.640><c> this</c><00:19:06.919><c> is</c>

00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
gross underestimation of what this is
 

00:19:07.159 --> 00:19:09.710 align:start position:0%
gross underestimation of what this is
which<00:19:07.280><c> is</c><00:19:07.559><c> it's</c><00:19:07.760><c> not</c><00:19:07.919><c> a</c><00:19:08.159><c> Sprint</c><00:19:09.159><c> but</c><00:19:09.320><c> a</c>

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
which is it's not a Sprint but a
 

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:14.110 align:start position:0%
which is it's not a Sprint but a
marathon<00:19:10.720><c> and</c><00:19:11.360><c> by</c><00:19:11.760><c> underestimation</c><00:19:12.760><c> I</c><00:19:13.120><c> mean</c>

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
marathon and by underestimation I mean
 

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.270 align:start position:0%
marathon and by underestimation I mean
it's<00:19:14.440><c> like</c><00:19:14.600><c> you're</c><00:19:14.880><c> sprinting</c><00:19:15.360><c> a</c>

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's like you're sprinting a
 

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.190 align:start position:0%
it's like you're sprinting a
marathon<00:19:18.280><c> and</c><00:19:18.440><c> there</c><00:19:18.799><c> hills</c><00:19:19.799><c> and</c><00:19:19.960><c> there</c>

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
marathon and there hills and there
 

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.750 align:start position:0%
marathon and there hills and there
mountains<00:19:20.640><c> along</c><00:19:20.919><c> the</c><00:19:21.039><c> way</c><00:19:21.280><c> that</c><00:19:21.440><c> you</c><00:19:21.559><c> didn't</c>

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
mountains along the way that you didn't
 

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
mountains along the way that you didn't

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
really expect they rainstorms there's
 

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.789 align:start position:0%
really expect they rainstorms there's
Avalanches<00:19:24.320><c> along</c><00:19:24.640><c> the</c>

00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
way there's you know those water
 

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.549 align:start position:0%
way there's you know those water

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
stations that you see from afar as you
 

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:32.909 align:start position:0%
stations that you see from afar as you
get<00:19:30.720><c> closer</c><00:19:31.039><c> to</c><00:19:31.280><c> them</c><00:19:31.480><c> they're</c><00:19:31.720><c> actually</c><00:19:31.960><c> just</c>

00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
get closer to them they're actually just
 

00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:37.630 align:start position:0%
get closer to them they're actually just
mirages<00:19:34.360><c> um</c><00:19:35.480><c> and</c><00:19:36.480><c> and</c><00:19:36.600><c> you</c><00:19:36.760><c> know</c><00:19:37.120><c> like</c><00:19:37.320><c> in</c><00:19:37.480><c> the</c>

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
mirages um and and you know like in the
 

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.149 align:start position:0%
mirages um and and you know like in the
in<00:19:37.760><c> the</c><00:19:37.880><c> Finish</c><00:19:38.200><c> Line</c><00:19:38.520><c> just</c><00:19:38.679><c> keeps</c><00:19:38.880><c> going</c>

00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
in the Finish Line just keeps going
 

00:19:39.159 --> 00:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
in the Finish Line just keeps going
further<00:19:39.520><c> and</c><00:19:39.679><c> further</c><00:19:40.000><c> and</c><00:19:40.159><c> further</c><00:19:40.480><c> away</c>

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
further and further and further away
 

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.149 align:start position:0%
further and further and further away
like<00:19:41.159><c> it</c><00:19:41.400><c> there</c><00:19:41.520><c> is</c><00:19:41.679><c> no</c><00:19:41.840><c> Finish</c><00:19:42.159><c> Line</c><00:19:42.480><c> really</c>

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
like it there is no Finish Line really
 

00:19:43.159 --> 00:19:46.510 align:start position:0%
like it there is no Finish Line really
so<00:19:43.320><c> it's</c><00:19:43.480><c> pretty</c><00:19:43.720><c> brutal</c><00:19:44.360><c> right</c><00:19:45.360><c> but</c><00:19:46.159><c> the</c><00:19:46.320><c> good</c>

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
so it's pretty brutal right but the good
 

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.190 align:start position:0%
so it's pretty brutal right but the good
news<00:19:46.760><c> is</c><00:19:46.919><c> that</c><00:19:47.120><c> you</c><00:19:47.280><c> and</c><00:19:47.440><c> I</c><00:19:47.559><c> are</c><00:19:47.799><c> here</c><00:19:48.320><c> because</c>

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
news is that you and I are here because
 

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.549 align:start position:0%
news is that you and I are here because
we're<00:19:49.640><c> just</c><00:19:49.840><c> a</c><00:19:49.960><c> little</c><00:19:50.200><c> bit</c><00:19:50.400><c> nuts</c><00:19:51.360><c> enough</c><00:19:52.360><c> to</c>

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
we're just a little bit nuts enough to
 

00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:54.590 align:start position:0%
we're just a little bit nuts enough to
think<00:19:52.960><c> that</c><00:19:53.159><c> you</c><00:19:53.320><c> know</c><00:19:53.600><c> to</c><00:19:53.840><c> have</c><00:19:54.039><c> that</c><00:19:54.200><c> to</c><00:19:54.360><c> be</c>

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
think that you know to have that to be
