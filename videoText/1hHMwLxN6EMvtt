00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
idea of what they want to build and so
 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.509 align:start position:0%
idea of what they want to build and so
they<00:02:56.319><c> kind</c><00:02:56.560><c> of</c><00:02:56.640><c> have</c><00:02:56.800><c> this</c><00:02:56.959><c> weird</c><00:02:57.280><c> feeling</c>

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 align:start position:0%
they kind of have this weird feeling

the reality is that
 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.630 align:start position:0%
the reality is that

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
really awesome idea in your head that
 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.430 align:start position:0%
really awesome idea in your head that
you<00:03:18.319><c> should</c><00:03:18.480><c> keep</c><00:03:18.720><c> in</c><00:03:18.800><c> your</c><00:03:18.959><c> head</c>

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
you should keep in your head
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.430 align:start position:0%
you should keep in your head
but<00:03:19.599><c> it</c><00:03:19.680><c> should</c><00:03:19.840><c> be</c><00:03:20.000><c> very</c><00:03:20.319><c> very</c><00:03:20.640><c> flexible</c>

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
but it should be very very flexible
 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.190 align:start position:0%
but it should be very very flexible
because<00:03:21.680><c> it</c><00:03:21.840><c> might</c><00:03:22.080><c> turn</c><00:03:22.319><c> out</c><00:03:22.560><c> the</c><00:03:22.720><c> full</c><00:03:22.959><c> thing</c>

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
because it might turn out the full thing
 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.070 align:start position:0%
because it might turn out the full thing
that<00:03:23.280><c> you</c><00:03:23.440><c> want</c><00:03:23.599><c> to</c><00:03:23.680><c> build</c>

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
that you want to build
 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.030 align:start position:0%
that you want to build
isn't<00:03:24.239><c> what</c><00:03:24.400><c> your</c><00:03:24.560><c> customers</c><00:03:24.959><c> want</c><00:03:25.280><c> at</c><00:03:25.440><c> all</c><00:03:26.640><c> so</c>

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.070 align:start position:0%
actually good at screwing in anything
but<00:03:56.799><c> i</c><00:03:56.879><c> wonder</c><00:03:57.120><c> what</c><00:03:57.280><c> other</c><00:03:57.599><c> problems</c><00:03:58.000><c> it</c>

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
but i wonder what other problems it
 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.830 align:start position:0%
but i wonder what other problems it
could<00:03:58.400><c> solve</c><00:03:58.879><c> and</c><00:03:59.040><c> they're</c><00:03:59.040><c> like</c><00:03:59.360><c> oh</c><00:03:59.519><c> maybe</c>

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
could solve and they're like oh maybe
 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.670 align:start position:0%
could solve and they're like oh maybe
you<00:04:00.000><c> can</c><00:04:00.080><c> use</c><00:04:00.319><c> it</c><00:04:00.480><c> to</c><00:04:00.640><c> cook</c><00:04:00.959><c> maybe</c><00:04:01.280><c> you</c><00:04:01.360><c> can</c><00:04:01.519><c> use</c>

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
you can use it to cook maybe you can use
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.030 align:start position:0%
you can use it to cook maybe you can use
it<00:04:01.840><c> to</c><00:04:02.000><c> clean</c><00:04:02.239><c> and</c><00:04:02.400><c> it's</c><00:04:02.560><c> like</c><00:04:02.720><c> no</c>

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
it to clean and it's like no
 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.190 align:start position:0%
it to clean and it's like no
like<00:04:03.920><c> the</c><00:04:04.159><c> problem</c><00:04:04.400><c> was</c><00:04:04.560><c> i</c><00:04:04.640><c> need</c><00:04:04.799><c> to</c><00:04:04.879><c> screw</c>
