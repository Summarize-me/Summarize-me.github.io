scale right like like because the
 

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
scale right like like because the

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:24.310 align:start position:0%
premise of fundraising is is that the
 

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
premise of fundraising is is that the

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.050 align:start position:0%
money is going to scale and that means
 

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
money is going to scale and that means
something<00:13:26.350><c> else</c><00:13:26.470><c> has</c><00:13:26.649><c> to</c><00:13:26.769><c> scale</c><00:13:26.980><c> to</c><00:13:27.310><c> produce</c>

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:27.490 align:start position:0%
something else has to scale to produce
 

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.370 align:start position:0%
something else has to scale to produce
that<00:13:27.790><c> scale</c><00:13:28.000><c> right</c><00:13:28.510><c> and</c><00:13:28.720><c> that</c><00:13:28.839><c> and</c><00:13:29.050><c> so</c><00:13:29.260><c> that's</c>

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:29.380 align:start position:0%
that scale right and that and so that's
 

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
that scale right and that and so that's

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:21.140 align:start position:0%
makes it so interesting you know and so
 

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:24.970 align:start position:0%
makes it so interesting you know and so
so<00:25:21.559><c> I</c><00:25:21.590><c> think</c><00:25:21.710><c> there's</c><00:25:22.420><c> I</c><00:25:23.420><c> mean</c><00:25:24.380><c> that's</c><00:25:24.740><c> just</c>

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:24.980 align:start position:0%
so I think there's I mean that's just
 

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:30.010 align:start position:0%
so I think there's I mean that's just

what we we were doing in 2004 but it was
 

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.450 align:start position:0%
what we we were doing in 2004 but it was
research<00:29:10.210><c> yeah</c><00:29:10.870><c> 10</c><00:29:11.290><c> years</c><00:29:11.320><c> ago</c><00:29:11.770><c> yeah</c><00:29:12.250><c> right</c>

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:12.460 align:start position:0%

and<00:29:12.610><c> like</c><00:29:12.790><c> the</c><00:29:13.300><c> fact</c><00:29:13.510><c> that</c><00:29:13.600><c> it's</c><00:29:13.810><c> new</c><00:29:14.020><c> to</c><00:29:14.200><c> you</c>

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
and like the fact that it's new to you
 

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.490 align:start position:0%
and like the fact that it's new to you
doesn't<00:29:15.400><c> mean</c><00:29:15.760><c> that</c><00:29:16.210><c> it's</c><00:29:16.420><c> new</c><00:29:16.720><c> right</c><00:29:17.290><c> like</c>

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:17.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it's new right like
 

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it's new right like
and<00:29:17.770><c> and</c><00:29:18.070><c> if</c><00:29:18.550><c> I</c><00:29:18.670><c> was</c><00:29:18.880><c> interested</c><00:29:19.150><c> in</c><00:29:19.830><c> scaling</c>

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:20.830 align:start position:0%
and and if I was interested in scaling
 

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
and and if I was interested in scaling
that<00:29:21.130><c> again</c><00:29:21.490><c> I</c><00:29:21.520><c> wouldn't</c><00:29:21.930><c> try</c><00:29:22.930><c> to</c><00:29:22.960><c> do</c><00:29:23.440><c> that</c>

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:23.710 align:start position:0%
that again I wouldn't try to do that
 

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:28.530 align:start position:0%
that again I wouldn't try to do that
there<00:29:24.160><c> and</c><00:29:24.280><c> so</c><00:29:24.940><c> for</c><00:29:25.570><c> me</c><00:29:25.810><c> I</c><00:29:26.610><c> came</c><00:29:27.610><c> to</c><00:29:28.000><c> the</c><00:29:28.270><c> Media</c>

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:28.540 align:start position:0%
there and so for me I came to the Media
 

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
there and so for me I came to the Media

00:46:17.849 --> 00:46:17.859 align:start position:0%
realize that it's that it's that it
 

00:46:17.859 --> 00:46:19.470 align:start position:0%
realize that it's that it's that it
really<00:46:18.040><c> is</c><00:46:18.220><c> unusual</c><00:46:18.400><c> then</c><00:46:19.180><c> I</c><00:46:19.210><c> had</c><00:46:19.390><c> to</c>

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
really is unusual then I had to
 

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
really is unusual then I had to
understand<00:46:19.960><c> why</c><00:46:20.530><c> you</c><00:46:20.950><c> would</c><00:46:21.099><c> even</c><00:46:21.339><c> want</c><00:46:21.670><c> that</c>

00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:21.849 align:start position:0%
understand why you would even want that
 

00:46:21.849 --> 00:46:24.390 align:start position:0%
understand why you would even want that
and<00:46:22.780><c> there's</c><00:46:23.500><c> a</c><00:46:23.560><c> couple</c><00:46:23.740><c> different</c><00:46:23.890><c> answers</c>

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple different answers
 

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple different answers
but<00:46:24.640><c> the</c><00:46:24.790><c> most</c><00:46:25.030><c> valuable</c><00:46:25.210><c> answer</c><00:46:26.020><c> I</c><00:46:26.050><c> think</c><00:46:26.200><c> is</c>

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:26.710 align:start position:0%
but the most valuable answer I think is
 

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
but the most valuable answer I think is
it's<00:46:27.520><c> what</c><00:46:27.760><c> allows</c><00:46:28.030><c> us</c><00:46:28.800><c> to</c><00:46:29.910><c> you</c><00:46:30.910><c> don't</c><00:46:31.180><c> start</c>

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:31.570 align:start position:0%
it's what allows us to you don't start
 

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.910 align:start position:0%
it's what allows us to you don't start
with<00:46:31.720><c> a</c><00:46:31.750><c> format</c><00:46:32.230><c> mm-hmm</c>

with a format mm-hmm
 

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
with a format mm-hmm
you<00:46:33.640><c> start</c><00:46:34.000><c> with</c><00:46:34.240><c> an</c><00:46:34.359><c> artist</c><00:46:34.690><c> or</c><00:46:35.410><c> you</c><00:46:35.500><c> start</c>

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:35.770 align:start position:0%
you start with an artist or you start
 

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:38.070 align:start position:0%
you start with an artist or you start
with<00:46:35.980><c> an</c><00:46:36.220><c> idea</c><00:46:36.609><c> and</c><00:46:37.270><c> then</c><00:46:37.450><c> you</c><00:46:37.660><c> figure</c><00:46:37.900><c> out</c>

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
with an idea and then you figure out
 

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
with an idea and then you figure out
like<00:46:38.740><c> what</c><00:46:39.010><c> does</c><00:46:39.339><c> that</c><00:46:39.400><c> become</c><00:46:39.849><c> and</c><00:46:40.060><c> that</c><00:46:41.670><c> that</c>

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:42.670 align:start position:0%
like what does that become and that that
 

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
like what does that become and that that
will<00:46:42.970><c> produce</c><00:46:43.260><c> new</c><00:46:44.260><c> forms</c><00:46:44.650><c> and</c><00:46:45.640><c> like</c><00:46:46.089><c> and</c><00:46:46.359><c> I'm</c>

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:46.450 align:start position:0%
will produce new forms and like and I'm
 

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
will produce new forms and like and I'm

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:51.490 align:start position:0%
that is like that is so necessary so

00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's like this big yeah yeah
 

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's like this big yeah yeah
and<00:47:41.650><c> like</c><00:47:42.599><c> so</c><00:47:43.599><c> there's</c><00:47:44.080><c> a</c><00:47:44.170><c> reason</c><00:47:44.619><c> the</c><00:47:45.339><c> the</c><00:47:45.910><c> the</c>

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:46.210 align:start position:0%
and like so there's a reason the the the
 

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:48.150 align:start position:0%
and like so there's a reason the the the
analogy<00:47:46.599><c> I</c><00:47:46.750><c> always</c><00:47:46.810><c> give</c><00:47:47.170><c> is</c><00:47:47.349><c> like</c><00:47:47.589><c> you</c><00:47:48.070><c> know</c>

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
analogy I always give is like you know
 

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
analogy I always give is like you know

float in the air but nobody is like wow
 

00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:53.970 align:start position:0%
float in the air but nobody is like wow
it'd<00:47:52.210><c> be</c><00:47:52.330><c> a</c><00:47:52.359><c> better</c><00:47:52.599><c> plane</c><00:47:52.900><c> if</c><00:47:53.260><c> it</c><00:47:53.589><c> also</c><00:47:53.740><c> had</c>

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:53.980 align:start position:0%
it'd be a better plane if it also had
 

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
it'd be a better plane if it also had

and it actually changes how we program
the<00:53:04.660><c> spaces</c><00:53:05.640><c> so</c><00:53:06.640><c> like</c><00:53:07.210><c> you</c><00:53:07.420><c> tweak</c><00:53:07.750><c> that</c><00:53:08.050><c> and</c>

all of these sort of pry or is that you
 

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.070 align:start position:0%
all of these sort of pry or is that you

that<00:56:57.130><c> cultural</c><00:56:57.819><c> institutions</c><00:56:58.270><c> can</c><00:56:58.450><c> do</c><00:56:58.660><c> now</c><00:56:58.930><c> is</c>

00:56:59.160 --> 00:56:59.170 align:start position:0%
that cultural institutions can do now is
 

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
