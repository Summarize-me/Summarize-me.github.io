00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:53.900 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
okay

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:53.910 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:10:53.910 --> 00:11:15.740 align:start position:0%
okay
so<00:10:54.440><c> go</c><00:10:55.440><c> ahead</c>

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:11:16.750><c> I</c><00:11:16.780><c> think</c><00:11:16.930><c> that</c><00:11:18.090><c> when</c><00:11:19.090><c> you're</c><00:11:19.210><c> trying</c><00:11:19.330><c> to</c>

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:19.450 align:start position:0%
so I think that when you're trying to
 

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.020 align:start position:0%
so I think that when you're trying to
figure<00:11:19.630><c> out</c><00:11:19.660><c> how</c><00:11:19.840><c> big</c><00:11:19.990><c> of</c><00:11:20.080><c> a</c><00:11:20.170><c> cheque</c><00:11:20.350><c> to</c><00:11:20.380><c> write</c>

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:21.030 align:start position:0%
figure out how big of a cheque to write
 

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
figure out how big of a cheque to write
what's<00:11:22.030><c> interesting</c><00:11:22.330><c> is</c><00:11:22.690><c> that</c><00:11:22.720><c> this</c><00:11:23.290><c> scales</c>

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:23.650 align:start position:0%
what's interesting is that this scales
 

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.790 align:start position:0%
what's interesting is that this scales
fairly<00:11:24.220><c> well</c><00:11:24.430><c> so</c><00:11:25.360><c> if</c><00:11:25.720><c> the</c><00:11:26.260><c> amount</c><00:11:26.380><c> of</c><00:11:26.500><c> if</c><00:11:26.650><c> you</c>

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
fairly well so if the amount of if you
 

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
fairly well so if the amount of if you
have<00:11:26.980><c> less</c><00:11:27.280><c> money</c><00:11:27.840><c> when</c><00:11:28.840><c> the</c><00:11:28.990><c> billion-dollar</c>

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.290 align:start position:0%
have less money when the billion-dollar
 

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.990 align:start position:0%
have less money when the billion-dollar
company<00:11:29.770><c> hits</c><00:11:29.980><c> you</c><00:11:30.190><c> have</c><00:11:30.310><c> to</c><00:11:30.430><c> make</c><00:11:30.580><c> less</c><00:11:30.790><c> of</c><00:11:30.910><c> a</c>

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
company hits you have to make less of a
 

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.270 align:start position:0%
company hits you have to make less of a

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
turn return for it to have a significant
 

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
impact when you have more money you need
to<00:11:35.920><c> make</c><00:11:36.040><c> more</c><00:11:36.310><c> of</c><00:11:36.370><c> a</c><00:11:36.490><c> return</c><00:11:36.730><c> have</c><00:11:36.940><c> sniffing</c>

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:37.270 align:start position:0%
to make more of a return have sniffing
 

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.330 align:start position:0%
to make more of a return have sniffing
impact<00:11:37.570><c> that</c><00:11:38.200><c> really</c><00:11:38.590><c> scales</c><00:11:38.920><c> your</c><00:11:39.130><c> check</c>

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:48.350 align:start position:0%
didn't have to and that created this

we don't screw that up I think that's
 

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
we don't screw that up I think that's

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:06.750 align:start position:0%
question was oh how do we you just
 

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.630 align:start position:0%
question was oh how do we you just
repeat<00:25:06.960><c> the</c><00:25:07.049><c> question</c><00:25:07.320><c> like</c><00:25:07.440><c> yeah</c><00:25:07.799><c> how</c><00:25:08.070><c> do</c><00:25:08.130><c> we</c>

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
repeat the question like yeah how do we
 

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.370 align:start position:0%
repeat the question like yeah how do we
kind<00:25:08.909><c> of</c><00:25:09.029><c> grade</c><00:25:09.240><c> ourselves</c><00:25:09.690><c> internally</c><00:25:09.960><c> at</c><00:25:10.230><c> YC</c>

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
kind of grade ourselves internally at YC
 

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.049 align:start position:0%
kind of grade ourselves internally at YC
because<00:25:11.159><c> it</c><00:25:11.250><c> takes</c><00:25:11.399><c> so</c><00:25:11.520><c> long</c><00:25:11.549><c> to</c><00:25:11.700><c> get</c><00:25:11.880><c> feedback</c>

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:12.059 align:start position:0%
because it takes so long to get feedback
 

00:25:12.059 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
because it takes so long to get feedback
it's<00:25:12.840><c> actually</c><00:25:13.169><c> interesting</c><00:25:13.830><c> um</c><00:25:14.690><c> one</c><00:25:15.690><c> thing</c>

00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:15.809 align:start position:0%
it's actually interesting um one thing

it's actually interesting um one thing

that batch experience went not I think
 

00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:41.810 align:start position:0%
that batch experience went not I think
for<00:25:41.070><c> the</c><00:25:41.130><c> companies</c><00:25:41.490><c> there</c><00:25:41.580><c> were</c><00:25:41.640><c> great</c>

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:43.470 align:start position:0%
companies but clearly something had to
 

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:44.690 align:start position:0%
companies but clearly something had to

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
change what the organization to be able
 

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
change what the organization to be able

to to accept that number of calm
 

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.910 align:start position:0%
to to accept that number of calm
again<00:25:46.800><c> I</c><00:25:47.010><c> think</c><00:25:47.580><c> that's</c><00:25:47.730><c> a</c><00:25:47.910><c> very</c><00:25:48.150><c> important</c>

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:48.920 align:start position:0%

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:52.050 align:start position:0%
thing that we look at more recently
 

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.750 align:start position:0%
thing that we look at more recently
we've<00:25:52.290><c> implemented</c><00:25:52.680><c> a</c><00:25:52.950><c> series</c><00:25:53.070><c> a</c><00:25:53.340><c> program</c>

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've implemented a series a program
 

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.250 align:start position:0%
we've implemented a series a program
that<00:25:54.000><c> helps</c><00:25:54.120><c> companies</c><00:25:54.540><c> raise</c><00:25:54.750><c> series</c><00:25:55.080><c> A's</c>

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
that helps companies raise series A's
 

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
that helps companies raise series A's
and<00:25:56.870><c> that's</c><00:25:57.870><c> basically</c><00:25:58.380><c> allowed</c><00:25:58.620><c> us</c><00:25:58.770><c> to</c><00:25:58.800><c> pay</c><00:25:59.100><c> a</c>

00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.130 align:start position:0%
and that's basically allowed us to pay a
 

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.550 align:start position:0%
and that's basically allowed us to pay a

the path from demo day to the next step
 

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:06.800 align:start position:0%

is kind of glaringly obvious over time
 

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
is kind of glaringly obvious over time
