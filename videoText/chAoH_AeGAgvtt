00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair statement I think
 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.389 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair statement I think
that's<00:01:36.240><c> a</c><00:01:36.360><c> fair</c><00:01:36.520><c> statement</c><00:01:37.079><c> and</c><00:01:37.240><c> so</c><00:01:38.119><c> if</c><00:01:38.200><c> you</c>

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's a fair statement and so if you
 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.830 align:start position:0%
that's a fair statement and so if you

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
do end an acquisition and many will end
 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.869 align:start position:0%
do end an acquisition and many will end
an<00:03:07.799><c> acquisition</c><00:03:08.799><c> um</c><00:03:09.640><c> oftentimes</c><00:03:10.159><c> you</c><00:03:10.319><c> have</c><00:03:10.440><c> to</c>

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 align:start position:0%
an acquisition um oftentimes you have to
 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.750 align:start position:0%
an acquisition um oftentimes you have to
reinie<00:03:11.879><c> for</c><00:03:12.120><c> your</c><00:03:12.360><c> job</c><00:03:12.840><c> like</c><00:03:13.120><c> often</c><00:03:13.440><c> times</c>

reinie for your job like often times
 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.470 align:start position:0%
reinie for your job like often times

they don't want to bring everyone over
in<00:03:15.599><c> the</c><00:03:15.799><c> acquisition</c><00:03:16.599><c> and</c><00:03:16.799><c> so</c><00:03:17.799><c> that's</c><00:03:18.040><c> tricky</c>

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
in the acquisition and so that's tricky
 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.789 align:start position:0%
in the acquisition and so that's tricky
and<00:03:18.840><c> also</c><00:03:19.080><c> you</c><00:03:19.159><c> might</c><00:03:19.360><c> end</c><00:03:19.519><c> up</c><00:03:19.680><c> at</c><00:03:19.799><c> a</c><00:03:20.440><c> the</c><00:03:20.599><c> big</c>

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
and also you might end up at a the big
 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.589 align:start position:0%
and also you might end up at a the big

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
tech company you were running away from
 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.390 align:start position:0%
tech company you were running away from
that's<00:03:22.799><c> right</c><00:03:23.440><c> um</c><00:03:23.799><c> when</c><00:03:23.920><c> you're</c><00:03:24.000><c> doing</c><00:03:24.280><c> a</c>

that's right um when you're doing a
startup<00:03:25.120><c> so</c><00:03:26.080><c> I</c><00:03:26.159><c> think</c><00:03:26.560><c> I</c><00:03:26.720><c> I</c><00:03:26.840><c> I'd</c><00:03:27.000><c> love</c><00:03:27.200><c> to</c><00:03:27.840><c> put</c>

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
startup so I think I I I'd love to put
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
startup so I think I I I'd love to put
in<00:03:28.200><c> a</c><00:03:28.480><c> kind</c><00:03:28.599><c> of</c><00:03:28.720><c> a</c><00:03:28.840><c> little</c><00:03:29.040><c> bit</c><00:03:29.200><c> of</c><00:03:29.400><c> a</c>

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
in a kind of a little bit of a
 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.869 align:start position:0%
in a kind of a little bit of a
a<00:03:30.560><c> note</c><00:03:30.920><c> here</c><00:03:31.799><c> I</c><00:03:31.959><c> think</c><00:03:32.239><c> that</c><00:03:32.560><c> those</c><00:03:33.000><c> 30%</c><00:03:33.760><c> that</c>

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 align:start position:0%
a note here I think that those 30% that
 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.070 align:start position:0%
a note here I think that those 30% that
will<00:03:34.040><c> do</c><00:03:34.680><c> well</c><00:03:35.680><c> um</c><00:03:36.319><c> will</c><00:03:36.599><c> probably</c><00:03:36.879><c> do</c>

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
will do well um will probably do

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
counterintuitively well like I think
 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.429 align:start position:0%
counterintuitively well like I think
like<00:03:39.799><c> really</c><00:03:39.959><c> well</c><00:03:40.280><c> yeah</c><00:03:40.400><c> like</c><00:03:40.680><c> very</c><00:03:40.959><c> well</c>

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.469 align:start position:0%
trade that's not a bad trade at all
that's<00:08:34.440><c> not</c><00:08:34.560><c> a</c><00:08:34.680><c> bad</c><00:08:34.800><c> trade</c><00:08:35.039><c> at</c><00:08:35.120><c> all</c><00:08:35.640><c> um</c><00:08:36.240><c> and</c><00:08:36.360><c> of</c>

that's not a bad trade at all um and of
 

00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:37.790 align:start position:0%
that's not a bad trade at all um and of
course<00:08:36.680><c> you</c><00:08:36.760><c> could</c><00:08:36.919><c> always</c><00:08:37.080><c> start</c><00:08:37.320><c> a</c><00:08:37.479><c> company</c>

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
course you could always start a company
 

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.509 align:start position:0%
course you could always start a company
as<00:08:37.959><c> well</c><00:08:38.279><c> which</c><00:08:38.399><c> is</c><00:08:38.680><c> just</c><00:08:38.959><c> the</c><00:08:39.800><c> Uber</c><00:08:40.200><c> version</c>

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
as well which is just the Uber version
 

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:44.550 align:start position:0%
as well which is just the Uber version
of<00:08:40.680><c> the</c><00:08:40.800><c> same</c><00:08:41.240><c> trade</c><00:08:42.240><c> exactly</c><00:08:43.080><c> yeah</c><00:08:44.080><c> so</c><00:08:44.440><c> I</c>

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
of the same trade exactly yeah so I
 

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.710 align:start position:0%
of the same trade exactly yeah so I
think<00:08:44.760><c> the</c><00:08:45.680><c> what</c><00:08:45.800><c> I</c><00:08:45.880><c> would</c><00:08:46.040><c> say</c><00:08:46.200><c> is</c><00:08:46.399><c> this</c><00:08:46.560><c> is</c>

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
think the what I would say is this is
 

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.790 align:start position:0%
think the what I would say is this is
that<00:08:46.880><c> you</c><00:08:46.959><c> know</c><00:08:47.399><c> this</c><00:08:47.519><c> is</c><00:08:47.720><c> tricky</c><00:08:48.440><c> right</c><00:08:48.680><c> I</c>

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
that you know this is tricky right I
 

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.910 align:start position:0%
that you know this is tricky right I
think<00:08:49.120><c> that</c><00:08:49.720><c> when</c><00:08:49.839><c> we</c><00:08:50.000><c> made</c><00:08:50.160><c> the</c><00:08:50.320><c> video</c><00:08:50.600><c> about</c>

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
think that when we made the video about
 

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.550 align:start position:0%
think that when we made the video about
Fang<00:08:51.920><c> fortunately</c><00:08:52.399><c> or</c><00:08:52.519><c> unfortunately</c><00:08:53.440><c> I</c>

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
Fang fortunately or unfortunately I
 

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.750 align:start position:0%
Fang fortunately or unfortunately I
think<00:08:53.720><c> that</c><00:08:53.839><c> you</c><00:08:53.959><c> know</c><00:08:54.120><c> Google</c><00:08:54.399><c> is</c><00:08:54.519><c> going</c><00:08:54.640><c> to</c>

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
think that you know Google is going to
 

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.630 align:start position:0%
think that you know Google is going to
look<00:08:55.080><c> very</c><00:08:55.399><c> similar</c><00:08:55.880><c> five</c><00:08:56.080><c> years</c><00:08:56.240><c> from</c><00:08:56.399><c> now</c><00:08:56.560><c> as</c>

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
look very similar five years from now as
 

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.750 align:start position:0%
look very similar five years from now as
it<00:08:56.760><c> looks</c><00:08:57.040><c> now</c><00:08:57.560><c> yep</c><00:08:58.240><c> and</c><00:08:58.720><c> I</c><00:08:58.839><c> think</c><00:08:59.040><c> that</c><00:08:59.320><c> that</c>

00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
it looks now yep and I think that that
 

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.230 align:start position:0%
it looks now yep and I think that that
for<00:09:00.040><c> those</c><00:09:00.240><c> of</c><00:09:00.399><c> you</c><00:09:00.640><c> who</c><00:09:00.800><c> are</c><00:09:00.920><c> at</c><00:09:01.560><c> unicorns</c><00:09:02.560><c> um</c>
