00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:01.430 align:start position:0%
difficult for people and at that point
 

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
difficult for people and at that point

series a basically right after YC and
 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.499 align:start position:0%

then<00:15:31.050><c> hired</c><00:15:31.290><c> and</c><00:15:31.590><c> so</c><00:15:31.710><c> our</c><00:15:31.830><c> process</c>

00:15:32.499 --> 00:15:32.509 align:start position:0%
then hired and so our process
 

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:35.379 align:start position:0%
then hired and so our process

00:15:35.379 --> 00:15:35.389 align:start position:0%

two-thirds outside of a side of SF okay
 

00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:38.979 align:start position:0%
two-thirds outside of a side of SF okay
so<00:16:36.529><c> we</c><00:16:36.649><c> have</c><00:16:36.769><c> headquarters</c><00:16:37.609><c> in</c><00:16:37.669><c> SF</c><00:16:37.999><c> and</c><00:16:38.329><c> but</c>

I don't know for certain but I think
 

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.609 align:start position:0%
I don't know for certain but I think
part<00:19:06.059><c> of</c><00:19:06.119><c> that</c><00:19:06.179><c> is</c><00:19:06.269><c> because</c><00:19:06.509><c> our</c><00:19:06.720><c> team</c><00:19:07.289><c> itself</c>

00:19:07.609 --> 00:19:07.619 align:start position:0%
part of that is because our team itself
 

00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
part of that is because our team itself
is<00:19:07.919><c> distributed</c><00:19:08.489><c> across</c><00:19:08.609><c> the</c><00:19:08.820><c> world</c><00:19:08.999><c> and</c><00:19:09.720><c> so</c>

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:09.929 align:start position:0%
is distributed across the world and so
 

00:19:09.929 --> 00:19:11.629 align:start position:0%
is distributed across the world and so
maybe<00:19:10.169><c> there's</c><00:19:10.409><c> this</c><00:19:10.739><c> level</c><00:19:11.129><c> of</c><00:19:11.190><c> empathy</c><00:19:11.340><c> or</c>

00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
maybe there's this level of empathy or
 

00:19:11.639 --> 00:19:13.999 align:start position:0%
maybe there's this level of empathy or
understanding<00:19:11.850><c> of</c><00:19:12.600><c> like</c><00:19:12.749><c> those</c><00:19:13.470><c> communities</c>

00:19:13.999 --> 00:19:14.009 align:start position:0%
understanding of like those communities
 

00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:14.810 align:start position:0%
understanding of like those communities
hmm

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
hmm
 

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.999 align:start position:0%
hmm
so<00:19:15.600><c> I</c><00:19:15.629><c> think</c><00:19:15.749><c> we'll</c><00:19:16.019><c> see</c><00:19:16.200><c> I</c><00:19:16.470><c> believe</c><00:19:16.769><c> we'll</c><00:19:16.889><c> see</c>

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:17.009 align:start position:0%
so I think we'll see I believe we'll see
 

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
so I think we'll see I believe we'll see
more<00:19:17.220><c> and</c><00:19:17.279><c> more</c><00:19:17.399><c> distribute</c><00:19:17.850><c> teams</c><00:19:18.029><c> more</c>

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:18.330 align:start position:0%
more and more distribute teams more
 

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.450 align:start position:0%
more and more distribute teams more

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
remote workers it's sort of this

00:19:22.159 --> 00:19:22.169 align:start position:0%
movement towards that direction and and
 

00:19:22.169 --> 00:19:23.749 align:start position:0%
movement towards that direction and and
I<00:19:22.649><c> think</c><00:19:22.830><c> more</c><00:19:22.950><c> people</c><00:19:23.070><c> will</c><00:19:23.279><c> be</c><00:19:23.340><c> willing</c><00:19:23.369><c> to</c>

00:19:23.749 --> 00:19:23.759 align:start position:0%
I think more people will be willing to
 

00:19:23.759 --> 00:19:25.849 align:start position:0%
I think more people will be willing to
build<00:19:24.720><c> teams</c><00:19:24.929><c> like</c><00:19:25.109><c> that</c><00:19:25.230><c> because</c><00:19:25.590><c> it's</c>

00:19:25.849 --> 00:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
build teams like that because it's
 

00:19:25.859 --> 00:19:28.099 align:start position:0%
build teams like that because it's
easier<00:19:26.220><c> to</c><00:19:26.309><c> to</c><00:19:27.119><c> work</c><00:19:27.299><c> remotely</c><00:19:27.539><c> with</c><00:19:27.809><c> slack</c>

this day that was not important what I
realize<00:36:49.279><c> is</c><00:36:49.460><c> if</c><00:36:49.609><c> we</c><00:36:49.759><c> went</c><00:36:49.910><c> down</c><00:36:50.089><c> that</c><00:36:50.119><c> route</c>

00:36:50.499 --> 00:36:50.509 align:start position:0%
realize is if we went down that route
 

00:36:50.509 --> 00:36:52.930 align:start position:0%
realize is if we went down that route
what<00:36:50.749><c> we</c><00:36:50.869><c> would</c><00:36:50.989><c> do</c><00:36:51.109><c> is</c><00:36:51.229><c> prioritize</c><00:36:51.940><c> building</c>

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:52.940 align:start position:0%
what we would do is prioritize building
 

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:56.499 align:start position:0%
what we would do is prioritize building

00:36:56.499 --> 00:36:56.509 align:start position:0%
like a platform for investors and that's
 

00:36:56.509 --> 00:36:58.539 align:start position:0%
like a platform for investors and that's
ultimately<00:36:56.809><c> not</c><00:36:57.049><c> what</c><00:36:57.559><c> we're</c><00:36:57.710><c> set</c><00:36:58.099><c> out</c><00:36:58.219><c> to</c><00:36:58.400><c> do</c>

00:36:58.539 --> 00:36:58.549 align:start position:0%

that<00:36:59.239><c> doesn't</c><00:36:59.479><c> mean</c><00:36:59.599><c> we're</c><00:36:59.719><c> not</c><00:36:59.839><c> going</c><00:37:00.109><c> to</c>

00:37:00.249 --> 00:37:00.259 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we're not going to
 

00:37:00.259 --> 00:37:02.109 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we're not going to

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
let's say the 1% and then it becomes
 

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.540 align:start position:0%
let's say the 1% and then it becomes
