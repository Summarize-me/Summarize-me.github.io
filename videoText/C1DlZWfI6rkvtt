don't actually want it at the end but
 

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.930 align:start position:0%
don't actually want it at the end but
it's<00:12:40.680><c> also</c><00:12:40.890><c> important</c><00:12:41.370><c> to</c><00:12:41.430><c> prove</c><00:12:41.640><c> it</c><00:12:41.790><c> to</c>

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
it's also important to prove it to

it's also important to prove it to

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:48.510 align:start position:0%
ways that you can do that the best way
 

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.930 align:start position:0%
ways that you can do that the best way
is<00:12:48.780><c> through</c><00:12:48.840><c> pre-sales</c><00:12:49.710><c> so</c><00:12:50.130><c> ideally</c><00:12:50.580><c> you</c><00:12:50.610><c> just</c>

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
is through pre-sales so ideally you just
 

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
is through pre-sales so ideally you just
sell<00:12:51.090><c> your</c><00:12:51.240><c> product</c><00:12:51.540><c> before</c><00:12:51.780><c> you</c><00:12:51.870><c> build</c><00:12:52.020><c> it</c>

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.170 align:start position:0%
sell your product before you build it
 

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.680 align:start position:0%

around that yes who I'll try to
 

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%

00:19:32.279 --> 00:19:32.289 align:start position:0%
seems like getting an LOI would be hard
 

00:19:32.289 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
seems like getting an LOI would be hard

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:34.990 align:start position:0%
you're actually going to be able to

you're actually going to be able to
deliver<00:19:35.320><c> it</c><00:19:35.530><c> and</c><00:19:35.679><c> they</c><00:19:35.770><c> have</c><00:19:35.919><c> to</c><00:19:36.039><c> like</c><00:19:36.190><c> plan</c>

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:36.549 align:start position:0%
deliver it and they have to like plan
 

00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:39.029 align:start position:0%

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:49.299 align:start position:0%
the very fact that they're hard is it
 

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%
the very fact that they're hard is it
makes<00:19:49.570><c> them</c><00:19:49.750><c> valuable</c><00:19:49.990><c> if</c><00:19:50.590><c> they</c><00:19:50.950><c> were</c><00:19:51.010><c> easy</c>

the reason that they're kind of valuable
 

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
the reason that they're kind of valuable

00:19:57.899 --> 00:19:57.909 align:start position:0%
is that it is hard to get a company to

00:19:59.880 --> 00:19:59.890 align:start position:0%
do that they'll typically only do it if
 

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.890 align:start position:0%
do that they'll typically only do it if
