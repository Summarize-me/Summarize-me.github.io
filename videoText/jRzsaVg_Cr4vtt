sky didn't fall and so I realized what a

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
narrow box I normally hold my idea of
 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
narrow box I normally hold my idea of
myself<00:02:58.299><c> in</c><00:02:58.870><c> and</c><00:02:59.159><c> so</c><00:03:00.159><c> what</c><00:03:00.400><c> that</c><00:03:00.459><c> project</c><00:03:00.909><c> was</c>

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 align:start position:0%
myself in and so what that project was
 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.710 align:start position:0%
myself in and so what that project was
really<00:03:01.209><c> successful</c><00:03:02.049><c> in</c><00:03:02.079><c> doing</c><00:03:02.470><c> was</c><00:03:02.650><c> just</c>

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
really successful in doing was just

people<00:07:35.890><c> feel</c><00:07:36.490><c> welcome</c><00:07:36.910><c> and</c><00:07:37.680><c> use</c><00:07:38.680><c> that</c><00:07:38.890><c> as</c><00:07:39.010><c> a</c>

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.100 align:start position:0%
people feel welcome and use that as a
 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
people feel welcome and use that as a
starting<00:07:39.280><c> point</c><00:07:39.580><c> not</c><00:07:39.760><c> like</c><00:07:39.940><c> oh</c><00:07:40.060><c> we</c><00:07:40.210><c> built</c><00:07:40.450><c> this</c>

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:40.570 align:start position:0%
starting point not like oh we built this
 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
starting point not like oh we built this
cool<00:07:40.900><c> tool</c><00:07:41.350><c> and</c><00:07:41.650><c> then</c><00:07:41.770><c> oh</c><00:07:42.010><c> crap</c><00:07:42.340><c> like</c><00:07:42.640><c> can</c><00:07:42.790><c> we</c>

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:42.850 align:start position:0%
cool tool and then oh crap like can we
 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.510 align:start position:0%
cool tool and then oh crap like can we
get<00:07:43.000><c> some</c><00:07:43.240><c> more</c><00:07:43.710><c> you</c><00:07:44.710><c> know</c><00:07:44.830><c> different</c><00:07:45.250><c> people</c>

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
get some more you know different people
 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
get some more you know different people
in<00:07:45.610><c> here</c><00:07:45.790><c> after</c><00:07:46.210><c> the</c><00:07:46.300><c> fact</c><00:07:46.540><c> and</c><00:07:48.270><c> yeah</c><00:07:49.270><c> so</c>

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.450 align:start position:0%
in here after the fact and yeah so
 

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.810 align:start position:0%
in here after the fact and yeah so
that's<00:07:49.570><c> you</c><00:07:49.960><c> know</c><00:07:49.990><c> I</c><00:07:50.110><c> like</c><00:07:50.950><c> JavaScript</c><00:07:51.580><c> I</c><00:07:51.669><c> like</c>

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:51.820 align:start position:0%
that's you know I like JavaScript I like
 

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.909 align:start position:0%
that's you know I like JavaScript I like
building<00:07:52.000><c> this</c><00:07:52.210><c> tool</c><00:07:52.450><c> but</c><00:07:52.660><c> that</c><00:07:52.720><c> is</c><00:07:53.080><c> the</c><00:07:53.380><c> the</c>

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
building this tool but that is the the
 

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
building this tool but that is the the
core<00:07:54.190><c> from</c><00:07:54.430><c> me</c><00:07:54.580><c> is</c><00:07:54.730><c> like</c><00:07:54.910><c> can</c><00:07:55.210><c> we</c><00:07:55.240><c> make</c><00:07:55.510><c> a</c><00:07:55.540><c> space</c>

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
core from me is like can we make a space
 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.290 align:start position:0%
core from me is like can we make a space
work<00:07:56.080><c> like</c><00:07:56.350><c> people</c><00:07:56.650><c> just</c><00:07:56.860><c> feel</c><00:07:57.430><c> comfortable</c>

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:37.420 align:start position:0%
um I think part of the difficulty comes
 

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
um I think part of the difficulty comes
out<00:22:37.570><c> of</c><00:22:37.690><c> just</c><00:22:37.930><c> like</c><00:22:38.080><c> the</c><00:22:38.860><c> market</c><00:22:39.310><c> around</c>

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:39.490 align:start position:0%
out of just like the market around
 

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.370 align:start position:0%
out of just like the market around
buying<00:22:39.670><c> selling</c><00:22:40.120><c> art</c><00:22:40.300><c> is</c><00:22:40.570><c> very</c><00:22:40.630><c> conservative</c>

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:41.380 align:start position:0%
buying selling art is very conservative
 

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.770 align:start position:0%
buying selling art is very conservative
because<00:22:41.860><c> you're</c><00:22:42.130><c> agreeing</c><00:22:42.970><c> that</c><00:22:43.270><c> this</c>

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:43.780 align:start position:0%
because you're agreeing that this
 

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.390 align:start position:0%
because you're agreeing that this
particular<00:22:44.170><c> object</c><00:22:44.290><c> has</c><00:22:44.620><c> this</c><00:22:44.800><c> value</c><00:22:45.010><c> that</c>

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
particular object has this value that
 

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
particular object has this value that
you<00:22:45.760><c> know</c><00:22:45.880><c> and</c><00:22:46.090><c> it's</c><00:22:46.210><c> all</c><00:22:46.300><c> kind</c><00:22:46.600><c> of</c><00:22:46.630><c> consensus</c>

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:47.170 align:start position:0%
you know and it's all kind of consensus
 

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
you know and it's all kind of consensus
based<00:22:47.410><c> so</c><00:22:47.650><c> there</c><00:22:47.830><c> it's</c><00:22:48.010><c> very</c><00:22:48.100><c> risk</c><00:22:48.520><c> adverse</c><00:22:48.820><c> in</c>

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.090 align:start position:0%
based so there it's very risk adverse in
 

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.490 align:start position:0%
based so there it's very risk adverse in
the<00:22:49.150><c> first</c><00:22:49.360><c> place</c><00:22:49.570><c> so</c><00:22:49.690><c> anything</c><00:22:49.960><c> digital</c><00:22:50.170><c> is</c>

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:50.500 align:start position:0%

you know learning what's the weather
today<00:31:36.190><c> and</c><00:31:36.550><c> I</c><00:31:37.000><c> ruined</c><00:31:37.410><c> but</c><00:31:38.410><c> I</c><00:31:38.440><c> had</c><00:31:38.650><c> this</c><00:31:38.770><c> like</c>

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:38.950 align:start position:0%
today and I ruined but I had this like
 

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
today and I ruined but I had this like
high<00:31:39.100><c> powers</c><00:31:39.700><c> argument</c><00:31:39.910><c> clock</c><00:31:41.280><c> well</c><00:31:42.280><c> so</c><00:31:42.460><c> I</c>

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:42.490 align:start position:0%
high powers argument clock well so I
 

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.090 align:start position:0%
high powers argument clock well so I
think<00:31:42.730><c> it</c><00:31:42.820><c> will</c><00:31:42.910><c> be</c><00:31:43.770><c> ideally</c><00:31:44.770><c> it</c><00:31:44.830><c> would</c><00:31:44.890><c> be</c>

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:45.100 align:start position:0%
think it will be ideally it would be
 

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.070 align:start position:0%
think it will be ideally it would be
like<00:31:45.280><c> a</c><00:31:45.460><c> year</c><00:31:45.820><c> or</c><00:31:45.940><c> something</c><00:31:46.180><c> fun</c><00:31:46.510><c> well</c><00:31:46.960><c> I</c>

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
like a year or something fun well I
 

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.570 align:start position:0%
like a year or something fun well I

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:48.580 align:start position:0%
think it will be like three days or
 

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.390 align:start position:0%
think it will be like three days or
something<00:31:48.670><c> because</c><00:31:49.980><c> what</c><00:31:50.980><c> happens</c><00:31:51.250><c> with</c><00:31:51.280><c> a</c>

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
something because what happens with a

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
projects together so we did this us+
 

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:16.210 align:start position:0%
projects together so we did this us+
project<00:41:12.440><c> that</c><00:41:12.800><c> I</c><00:41:12.830><c> mentioned</c><00:41:13.960><c> his</c><00:41:14.960><c> he's</c><00:41:15.650><c> maybe</c>

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:16.220 align:start position:0%
project that I mentioned his he's maybe
 

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:20.140 align:start position:0%
project that I mentioned his he's maybe
a<00:41:16.340><c> little</c><00:41:16.520><c> bit</c><00:41:18.160><c> dives</c><00:41:19.160><c> deeper</c><00:41:19.700><c> and</c><00:41:19.820><c> some</c><00:41:20.030><c> of</c>

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:20.150 align:start position:0%
a little bit dives deeper and some of
 

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:23.050 align:start position:0%
a little bit dives deeper and some of
the<00:41:20.859><c> theory</c><00:41:21.859><c> and</c><00:41:21.950><c> technical</c><00:41:22.520><c> things</c><00:41:22.760><c> that</c><00:41:22.880><c> are</c>

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:23.060 align:start position:0%
the theory and technical things that are
 

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.750 align:start position:0%
the theory and technical things that are
possible<00:41:23.450><c> and</c><00:41:23.600><c> so</c><00:41:24.040><c> right</c><00:41:25.040><c> now</c><00:41:25.190><c> he's</c><00:41:25.400><c> working</c><00:41:25.550><c> a</c>

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
possible and so right now he's working a
 

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.910 align:start position:0%
possible and so right now he's working a
lot<00:41:25.940><c> of</c><00:41:26.000><c> like</c><00:41:26.210><c> machine</c><00:41:26.630><c> learning</c><00:41:26.920><c> experiment</c>

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
lot of like machine learning experiment
 

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
lot of like machine learning experiment
and<00:41:28.400><c> doing</c><00:41:29.359><c> some</c><00:41:29.510><c> really</c><00:41:29.690><c> close</c><00:41:30.320><c> up</c><00:41:30.350><c> of</c><00:41:30.530><c> that</c>

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:31.150 align:start position:0%
and doing some really close up of that
 

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.300 align:start position:0%
and doing some really close up of that
recent<00:41:32.150><c> before</c><00:41:32.480><c> that</c><00:41:32.630><c> he</c><00:41:32.750><c> was</c><00:41:32.840><c> really</c><00:41:33.310><c> focused</c>

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:34.310 align:start position:0%
recent before that he was really focused
 

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.710 align:start position:0%
recent before that he was really focused
on<00:41:34.369><c> computer</c><00:41:34.790><c> vision</c><00:41:34.820><c> so</c><00:41:35.240><c> he</c><00:41:35.330><c> did</c><00:41:35.480><c> this</c><00:41:35.540><c> one</c>

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
on computer vision so he did this one
 

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.460 align:start position:0%
on computer vision so he did this one
project<00:41:36.170><c> where</c><00:41:36.400><c> he</c><00:41:37.630><c> had</c><00:41:38.630><c> this</c><00:41:38.750><c> like</c><00:41:38.930><c> pile</c><00:41:39.170><c> of</c>

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:39.470 align:start position:0%
project where he had this like pile of
 

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:41.890 align:start position:0%
project where he had this like pile of

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:41.900 align:start position:0%
mirror balls like disco balls and then
 

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:44.590 align:start position:0%
mirror balls like disco balls and then
he<00:41:42.020><c> was</c><00:41:42.160><c> had</c><00:41:43.160><c> a</c><00:41:43.460><c> number</c><00:41:44.090><c> of</c><00:41:44.150><c> projectors</c><00:41:44.570><c> that</c>

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
he was had a number of projectors that
 

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%

it bounced off of the falls it would
 

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
it bounced off of the falls it would
