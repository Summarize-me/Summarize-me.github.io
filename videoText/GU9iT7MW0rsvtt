it's<00:01:24.040><c> sort</c><00:01:24.200><c> of</c><00:01:24.280><c> like</c><00:01:24.439><c> an</c><00:01:24.560><c> idea</c><00:01:24.840><c> that</c><00:01:25.040><c> came</c><00:01:25.280><c> up</c>

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like an idea that came up
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.749 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like an idea that came up
in<00:01:25.600><c> the</c><00:01:25.840><c> last</c>

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
video and I think you know we try to
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.590 align:start position:0%
video and I think you know we try to
define<00:01:29.600><c> a</c><00:01:29.680><c> different</c><00:01:30.040><c> way</c><00:01:30.159><c> why</c><00:01:30.240><c> don't</c><00:01:30.360><c> you</c><00:01:30.439><c> try</c>

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
define a different way why don't you try
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.109 align:start position:0%
define a different way why don't you try
to<00:01:30.799><c> give</c><00:01:30.920><c> the</c><00:01:31.040><c> definition</c><00:01:31.479><c> and</c><00:01:31.759><c> you</c><00:01:31.840><c> should</c>

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
to give the definition and you should
 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.590 align:start position:0%
to give the definition and you should
watch<00:01:32.320><c> the</c><00:01:32.479><c> video</c><00:01:33.439><c> watch</c><00:01:34.000><c> yes</c><00:01:34.159><c> but</c><00:01:34.280><c> we</c><00:01:34.360><c> should</c>

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
watch the video watch yes but we should
 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.950 align:start position:0%
watch the video watch yes but we should
we<00:01:34.720><c> should</c><00:01:34.920><c> restart</c><00:01:35.479><c> right</c><00:01:35.640><c> so</c><00:01:36.479><c> the</c><00:01:36.640><c> idea</c>

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
we should restart right so the idea

okay<00:07:14.720><c> let's</c><00:07:15.000><c> see</c><00:07:15.960><c> and</c><00:07:16.039><c> so</c><00:07:16.199><c> I</c><00:07:16.280><c> think</c><00:07:16.440><c> that's</c><00:07:16.599><c> the</c>

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
okay let's see and so I think that's the
 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.029 align:start position:0%
okay let's see and so I think that's the
other<00:07:16.919><c> thing</c><00:07:17.080><c> that</c><00:07:17.199><c> you</c><00:07:17.319><c> should</c><00:07:17.560><c> kind</c><00:07:17.680><c> of</c>

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
other thing that you should kind of
 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:19.350 align:start position:0%
other thing that you should kind of
understand<00:07:18.199><c> from</c><00:07:18.360><c> our</c><00:07:18.599><c> perspective</c><00:07:19.160><c> we're</c>

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
understand from our perspective we're
 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.189 align:start position:0%
understand from our perspective we're
definitely<00:07:19.800><c> in</c><00:07:19.960><c> a</c><00:07:20.319><c> okay</c><00:07:20.680><c> let's</c><00:07:20.960><c> see</c><00:07:21.199><c> phase</c>

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
definitely in a okay let's see phase
 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:26.710 align:start position:0%
definitely in a okay let's see phase
compared<00:07:22.599><c> to</c><00:07:22.960><c> like</c><00:07:23.919><c> 10</c><00:07:24.280><c> years</c><00:07:24.599><c> into</c><00:07:25.039><c> B2B</c><00:07:25.720><c> SAS</c>

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.830 align:start position:0%
compared to like 10 years into B2B SAS
it<00:07:26.800><c> was</c><00:07:26.960><c> like</c><00:07:27.160><c> we've</c><00:07:27.319><c> seen</c><00:07:27.560><c> a</c><00:07:27.759><c> lot</c><00:07:28.120><c> of</c><00:07:28.680><c> we've</c>

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
it was like we've seen a lot of we've
 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.390 align:start position:0%
it was like we've seen a lot of we've

seen a lot of forms and
 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.830 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of forms and
like<00:07:32.400><c> yeah</c><00:07:32.800><c> so</c><00:07:32.960><c> I</c><00:07:33.039><c> think</c><00:07:33.240><c> that</c><00:07:33.400><c> like</c><00:07:33.639><c> that's</c>

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
like yeah so I think that like that's
 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.830 align:start position:0%
