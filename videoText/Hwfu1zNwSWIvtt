00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
and so they're worried that if they just
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.350 align:start position:0%
and so they're worried that if they just

try going after those big companies they
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.030 align:start position:0%
try going after those big companies they

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
won't get any traction
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.110 align:start position:0%
won't get any traction
and<00:02:13.440><c> the</c><00:02:13.520><c> company</c><00:02:13.920><c> will</c><00:02:14.000><c> never</c><00:02:14.239><c> take</c><00:02:14.480><c> off</c><00:02:14.959><c> and</c>

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
and the company will never take off and
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.949 align:start position:0%
and the company will never take off and
so<00:02:15.280><c> therefore</c><00:02:15.840><c> they</c><00:02:16.080><c> should</c><00:02:16.239><c> try</c><00:02:16.560><c> selling</c>

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 align:start position:0%
so therefore they should try selling
