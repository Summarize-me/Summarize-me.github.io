and Facebook started during reading
 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.510 align:start position:0%
and Facebook started during reading
period<00:05:43.280><c> yeah</c><00:05:43.360><c> so</c><00:05:43.479><c> Harvard</c><00:05:43.800><c> likes</c><00:05:44.080><c> canceling</c>

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
period yeah so Harvard likes canceling
 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.390 align:start position:0%
period yeah so Harvard likes canceling
things<00:05:44.720><c> that</c><00:05:44.880><c> work</c><00:05:45.479><c> so</c><00:05:45.840><c> um</c>

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
things that work so um
 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.070 align:start position:0%
things that work so um
the<00:05:48.479><c> um</c>

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
the um
 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.749 align:start position:0%
the um
but<00:05:51.080><c> so</c><00:05:51.280><c> basically</c><00:05:51.800><c> it's</c><00:05:51.919><c> this</c><00:05:52.120><c> period</c><00:05:52.440><c> during</c>

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
actually it goes both ways though right
 

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:04.310 align:start position:0%
actually it goes both ways though right
I<00:11:01.440><c> mean</c><00:11:01.680><c> a</c><00:11:01.800><c> lot</c><00:11:01.920><c> of</c><00:11:02.120><c> the</c><00:11:03.120><c> advantage</c><00:11:03.639><c> of</c><00:11:03.839><c> that</c><00:11:04.040><c> is</c>

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.750 align:start position:0%

it's if if you're always talking into
 

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:10.389 align:start position:0%
it's if if you're always talking into

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
of the reason why bigger companies
 

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.629 align:start position:0%

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
didn't invest in it was because it
 

00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.990 align:start position:0%
didn't invest in it was because it
wasn't<00:15:42.880><c> clear</c><00:15:43.160><c> that</c><00:15:43.279><c> there</c><00:15:43.360><c> was</c><00:15:43.480><c> a</c><00:15:43.600><c> model</c><00:15:43.880><c> that</c>

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear that there was a model that
 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.629 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear that there was a model that
would<00:15:44.160><c> work</c><00:15:44.360><c> for</c><00:15:44.519><c> it</c><00:15:44.720><c> it</c><00:15:44.880><c> seemed</c><00:15:45.160><c> like</c><00:15:45.279><c> a</c><00:15:45.399><c> bad</c>

00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
would work for it it seemed like a bad
 

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:47.790 align:start position:0%
would work for it it seemed like a bad
idea<00:15:46.120><c> yeah</c><00:15:46.360><c> and</c><00:15:47.199><c> I</c><00:15:47.319><c> actually</c><00:15:47.519><c> think</c><00:15:47.680><c> that</c>

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
idea yeah and I actually think that
 

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.910 align:start position:0%
idea yeah and I actually think that
that's<00:15:47.959><c> true</c><00:15:48.160><c> for</c><00:15:48.360><c> a</c><00:15:48.440><c> lot</c><00:15:48.560><c> of</c><00:15:48.720><c> the</c><00:15:48.880><c> best</c><00:15:49.160><c> ideas</c>

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's true for a lot of the best ideas
 

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
that's true for a lot of the best ideas
right<00:15:50.079><c> is</c><00:15:50.279><c> that</c><00:15:50.639><c> it's</c><00:15:50.839><c> not</c><00:15:51.040><c> that</c><00:15:51.160><c> someone</c><00:15:51.399><c> else</c>

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
right is that it's not that someone else
 

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.430 align:start position:0%
right is that it's not that someone else
can't<00:15:51.920><c> do</c><00:15:52.040><c> it</c><00:15:52.279><c> they</c><00:15:52.440><c> actually</c><00:15:52.720><c> can</c><00:15:53.199><c> and</c><00:15:53.279><c> the</c>

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
can't do it they actually can and the
 

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
can't do it they actually can and the
odds<00:15:53.720><c> are</c><00:15:53.880><c> stacked</c><00:15:54.319><c> against</c><00:15:54.560><c> you</c><00:15:55.000><c> but</c><00:15:55.120><c> I</c><00:15:55.199><c> think</c>

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
odds are stacked against you but I think
 

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
odds are stacked against you but I think
often<00:15:55.800><c> that</c><00:15:56.040><c> belief</c><00:15:56.440><c> in</c><00:15:56.600><c> the</c><00:15:56.720><c> fact</c><00:15:56.880><c> that</c><00:15:57.000><c> you</c>

often that belief in the fact that you
 

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.590 align:start position:0%
often that belief in the fact that you

to actually get close closer to that we
 

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.030 align:start position:0%
to actually get close closer to that we

determining if someone's really good so
over<00:22:30.600><c> time</c><00:22:30.840><c> what</c><00:22:30.919><c> I</c><00:22:31.039><c> figured</c><00:22:31.400><c> out</c><00:22:31.960><c> was</c><00:22:32.080><c> that</c>

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
over time what I figured out was that
 

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.990 align:start position:0%
over time what I figured out was that
the<00:22:32.400><c> only</c><00:22:32.720><c> actual</c><00:22:33.080><c> way</c><00:22:33.279><c> to</c><00:22:33.440><c> let</c><00:22:33.600><c> someone</c>

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
the only actual way to let someone
 

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.590 align:start position:0%
the only actual way to let someone
analyze<00:22:34.640><c> whether</c><00:22:35.039><c> someone</c><00:22:35.559><c> was</c><00:22:35.760><c> really</c><00:22:36.039><c> good</c>

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
analyze whether someone was really good
 

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.190 align:start position:0%
analyze whether someone was really good
was<00:22:36.799><c> if</c><00:22:36.960><c> they</c><00:22:37.080><c> would</c><00:22:37.279><c> work</c><00:22:37.520><c> for</c><00:22:37.840><c> that</c><00:22:38.200><c> person</c>

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
was if they would work for that person
 

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.789 align:start position:0%
was if they would work for that person
so<00:22:39.600><c> I</c><00:22:39.679><c> don't</c><00:22:39.840><c> think</c><00:22:40.039><c> that</c><00:22:40.120><c> needs</c><00:22:40.279><c> to</c><00:22:40.400><c> recurse</c>

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that needs to recurse
 

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.750 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that needs to recurse
too<00:22:40.960><c> many</c><00:22:41.159><c> levels</c><00:22:41.520><c> down</c><00:22:41.679><c> in</c><00:22:41.799><c> the</c><00:22:41.919><c> organization</c>

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
too many levels down in the organization
 

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.390 align:start position:0%
too many levels down in the organization
but<00:22:43.080><c> I</c><00:22:43.200><c> basically</c><00:22:43.559><c> think</c><00:22:43.679><c> that</c><00:22:43.840><c> that's</c><00:22:43.960><c> like</c><00:22:44.120><c> a</c>

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
but I basically think that that's like a
 

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.310 align:start position:0%
but I basically think that that's like a
that's<00:22:44.520><c> a</c><00:22:44.679><c> really</c><00:22:44.840><c> good</c><00:22:45.039><c> heuristic</c><00:22:45.760><c> right</c><00:22:45.960><c> and</c>

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's a really good heuristic right and
 

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.390 align:start position:0%
that's a really good heuristic right and
and<00:22:46.559><c> I</c><00:22:46.880><c> I</c><00:22:47.000><c> believe</c><00:22:47.360><c> that</c><00:22:47.559><c> I</c><00:22:47.600><c> mean</c><00:22:47.799><c> for</c><00:22:48.200><c> if</c><00:22:48.279><c> you</c>
