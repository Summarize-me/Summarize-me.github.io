00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:43.510 align:start position:0%
it we did it a long time ago back in
 

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.389 align:start position:0%
it we did it a long time ago back in
2010<00:16:43.990><c> and</c><00:16:44.319><c> I</c><00:16:44.380><c> know</c><00:16:44.440><c> because</c><00:16:44.680><c> I</c><00:16:44.829><c> presented</c><00:16:45.100><c> had</c>

00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
2010 and I know because I presented had
 

00:16:45.399 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
2010 and I know because I presented had
it<00:16:45.519><c> and</c><00:16:46.480><c> it</c><00:16:47.139><c> was</c><00:16:47.230><c> it</c><00:16:47.649><c> was</c><00:16:47.769><c> great</c><00:16:47.920><c> and</c><00:16:48.660><c> the</c><00:16:49.660><c> only</c>

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:49.810 align:start position:0%
it and it was it was great and the only
 

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.269 align:start position:0%
it and it was it was great and the only
reason<00:16:50.079><c> that</c><00:16:50.230><c> we</c><00:16:50.350><c> didn't</c><00:16:50.560><c> keep</c><00:16:50.680><c> doing</c><00:16:50.980><c> it</c><00:16:51.100><c> was</c>

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
reason that we didn't keep doing it was
 

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
reason that we didn't keep doing it was
that<00:16:51.430><c> it</c><00:16:51.490><c> was</c><00:16:51.579><c> a</c><00:16:51.639><c> lot</c><00:16:51.760><c> of</c><00:16:51.790><c> work</c><00:16:52.089><c> and</c><00:16:52.360><c> YC</c><00:16:52.750><c> was</c>

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:52.930 align:start position:0%
that it was a lot of work and YC was
 

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:56.069 align:start position:0%
that it was a lot of work and YC was
very<00:16:53.110><c> short-staffed</c><00:16:53.649><c> at</c><00:16:54.010><c> the</c><00:16:54.279><c> time</c><00:16:54.639><c> and</c><00:16:55.569><c> so</c><00:16:55.810><c> we</c>

00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
very short-staffed at the time and so we
 

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:58.110 align:start position:0%
very short-staffed at the time and so we
just<00:16:56.260><c> sort</c><00:16:56.440><c> of</c><00:16:56.500><c> like</c><00:16:56.709><c> paused</c><00:16:57.130><c> it</c><00:16:57.399><c> for</c><00:16:57.790><c> a</c><00:16:57.819><c> number</c>

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
just sort of like paused it for a number
 

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
just sort of like paused it for a number
of<00:16:58.360><c> years</c><00:16:58.600><c> but</c><00:16:58.899><c> I'm</c><00:16:59.260><c> really</c><00:16:59.680><c> excited</c><00:17:00.040><c> that</c>

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:00.310 align:start position:0%
of years but I'm really excited that
 

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
of years but I'm really excited that
we're<00:17:00.430><c> going</c><00:17:00.579><c> to</c><00:17:00.730><c> bring</c><00:17:01.569><c> it</c><00:17:01.660><c> back</c><00:17:01.689><c> and</c><00:17:02.589><c> YC</c><00:17:03.279><c> has</c>

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:03.490 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring it back and YC has
 

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.579 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring it back and YC has
grown<00:17:03.760><c> a</c><00:17:03.970><c> lot</c><00:17:04.299><c> since</c><00:17:04.360><c> then</c><00:17:04.929><c> we're</c><00:17:05.140><c> ten</c><00:17:05.380><c> times</c>

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:05.589 align:start position:0%
grown a lot since then we're ten times
 

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.350 align:start position:0%
grown a lot since then we're ten times
the<00:17:05.829><c> size</c><00:17:06.010><c> and</c><00:17:06.339><c> so</c><00:17:06.459><c> the</c><00:17:06.640><c> converse</c><00:17:06.939><c> is</c><00:17:07.059><c> gonna</c><00:17:07.240><c> be</c>

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
the size and so the converse is gonna be
 

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
the size and so the converse is gonna be
about<00:17:07.510><c> ten</c><00:17:07.720><c> times</c><00:17:07.839><c> the</c><00:17:08.049><c> size</c><00:17:08.260><c> how</c><00:17:08.829><c> did</c><00:17:08.949><c> Wes</c>

00:17:09.059 --> 00:17:09.069 align:start position:0%
about ten times the size how did Wes
 

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
about ten times the size how did Wes
back<00:17:09.220><c> yeah</c><00:17:09.429><c> it's</c><00:17:09.669><c> gonna</c><00:17:09.790><c> be</c><00:17:10.000><c> really</c><00:17:10.839><c> big</c><00:17:11.110><c> yeah</c>

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:11.589 align:start position:0%
back yeah it's gonna be really big yeah
 

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:13.890 align:start position:0%
back yeah it's gonna be really big yeah
and<00:17:11.799><c> so</c><00:17:12.069><c> how</c><00:17:12.280><c> it</c><00:17:12.400><c> works</c><00:17:12.429><c> is</c><00:17:12.819><c> it's</c><00:17:13.419><c> similar</c><00:17:13.750><c> to</c>

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:13.900 align:start position:0%
and so how it works is it's similar to
 

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.970 align:start position:0%
and so how it works is it's similar to
ycs<00:17:14.549><c> demo</c><00:17:15.549><c> day</c><00:17:15.699><c> but</c><00:17:16.209><c> for</c><00:17:16.750><c> employees</c><00:17:17.500><c> instead</c>

I<00:23:50.090><c> think</c><00:23:50.299><c> that</c><00:23:50.539><c> like</c><00:23:50.740><c> reframing</c><00:23:51.740><c> the</c><00:23:52.399><c> just</c><00:23:52.700><c> the</c>

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:52.820 align:start position:0%
I think that like reframing the just the
 

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.759 align:start position:0%
I think that like reframing the just the
terms<00:23:53.120><c> start</c><00:23:53.450><c> up</c><00:23:53.600><c> to</c><00:23:53.870><c> be</c><00:23:53.990><c> much</c><00:23:54.200><c> broader</c><00:23:54.440><c> than</c>

00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:54.769 align:start position:0%
terms start up to be much broader than
 

00:23:54.769 --> 00:23:57.639 align:start position:0%
terms start up to be much broader than
SAS<00:23:55.429><c> companies</c><00:23:55.879><c> is</c><00:23:56.870><c> an</c><00:23:57.080><c> important</c><00:23:57.440><c> thing</c><00:23:57.590><c> that</c>

00:23:57.639 --> 00:23:57.649 align:start position:0%
SAS companies is an important thing that
 

00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
SAS companies is an important thing that
you<00:23:57.919><c> guys</c><00:23:58.039><c> are</c><00:23:58.220><c> doing</c><00:23:58.309><c> yeah</c><00:23:58.909><c> I</c><00:23:59.179><c> think</c><00:23:59.419><c> it's</c><00:23:59.600><c> a</c>

00:23:59.680 --> 00:23:59.690 align:start position:0%
you guys are doing yeah I think it's a
 

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.879 align:start position:0%
you guys are doing yeah I think it's a
great<00:23:59.840><c> point</c><00:23:59.960><c> I</c><00:24:00.080><c> think</c><00:24:00.259><c> a</c><00:24:00.289><c> lot</c><00:24:00.409><c> of</c><00:24:00.529><c> Engineers</c>

00:24:00.879 --> 00:24:00.889 align:start position:0%
great point I think a lot of Engineers
 

00:24:00.889 --> 00:24:02.860 align:start position:0%
great point I think a lot of Engineers
don't<00:24:01.100><c> realize</c><00:24:01.610><c> just</c><00:24:02.029><c> how</c>
