it by
 

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.710 align:start position:0%
it by
yourself<00:13:23.120><c> so</c><00:13:23.320><c> the</c><00:13:23.480><c> next</c><00:13:23.800><c> question</c><00:13:24.120><c> is</c><00:13:24.360><c> about</c>

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
yourself so the next question is about
 

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.870 align:start position:0%
yourself so the next question is about
average<00:13:25.120><c> age</c><00:13:25.560><c> so</c><00:13:25.959><c> what</c><00:13:26.079><c> is</c><00:13:26.199><c> the</c><00:13:26.399><c> average</c><00:13:26.680><c> age</c>

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%

00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
currently is around 30 um and so it
 

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.949 align:start position:0%
currently is around 30 um and so it

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more on that as well well I
 

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.230 align:start position:0%
little bit more on that as well well I
think<00:13:59.680><c> the</c><00:14:00.240><c> average</c><00:14:00.720><c> age</c><00:14:01.040><c> of</c><00:14:01.199><c> a</c><00:14:01.440><c> YC</c><00:14:01.839><c> founder</c>

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
think the average age of a YC founder
 

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.749 align:start position:0%
think the average age of a YC founder
and<00:14:02.399><c> this</c><00:14:02.519><c> is</c><00:14:02.800><c> not</c><00:14:03.360><c> exact</c><00:14:03.880><c> numbers</c><00:14:04.399><c> I</c><00:14:04.519><c> think</c>

00:14:04.749 --> 00:14:04.759 align:start position:0%
and this is not exact numbers I think
 

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:05.710 align:start position:0%
and this is not exact numbers I think
was

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
