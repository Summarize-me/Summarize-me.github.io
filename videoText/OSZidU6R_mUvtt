and I think so you'll go through that
 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:43.879 align:start position:0%
and I think so you'll go through that
right<00:06:42.119><c> and</c><00:06:42.389><c> you'll</c><00:06:42.779><c> say</c><00:06:42.990><c> okay</c><00:06:43.439><c> and</c><00:06:43.619><c> you'll</c><00:06:43.770><c> get</c>
