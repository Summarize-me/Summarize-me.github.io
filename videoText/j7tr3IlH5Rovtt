with is going to be the person they know
more<00:22:27.230><c> and</c><00:22:27.470><c> so</c><00:22:27.830><c> if</c><00:22:27.890><c> that</c><00:22:28.039><c> person</c><00:22:28.340><c> leaves</c>

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:28.370 align:start position:0%
more and so if that person leaves
 

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
more and so if that person leaves
they're<00:22:28.700><c> going</c><00:22:28.850><c> to</c><00:22:28.909><c> go</c><00:22:29.000><c> well</c><00:22:29.240><c> like</c><00:22:30.110><c> should</c>

00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:30.289 align:start position:0%
they're going to go well like should
 

00:22:30.289 --> 00:22:32.890 align:start position:0%
they're going to go well like should
have<00:22:30.409><c> I</c><00:22:30.500><c> left</c><00:22:30.770><c> to</c><00:22:31.120><c> like</c><00:22:32.120><c> what</c><00:22:32.360><c> did</c><00:22:32.480><c> they</c><00:22:32.659><c> get</c>

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:32.900 align:start position:0%
have I left to like what did they get
 

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
have I left to like what did they get
and<00:22:33.169><c> how</c><00:22:33.289><c> does</c><00:22:33.350><c> that</c><00:22:33.470><c> compare</c><00:22:33.620><c> to</c><00:22:34.240><c> my</c><00:22:35.240><c> deal</c><00:22:37.809><c> and</c>

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.130 align:start position:0%
and how does that compare to my deal and
 

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
and how does that compare to my deal and
so<00:22:40.130><c> like</c><00:22:40.549><c> if</c><00:22:40.669><c> we</c><00:22:40.730><c> look</c><00:22:40.909><c> at</c><00:22:41.030><c> the</c><00:22:41.120><c> situation</c><00:22:41.720><c> and</c>

00:22:41.919 --> 00:22:41.929 align:start position:0%
so like if we look at the situation and
 

00:22:41.929 --> 00:22:45.340 align:start position:0%
so like if we look at the situation and
we<00:22:42.710><c> try</c><00:22:42.890><c> and</c><00:22:42.919><c> analyze</c><00:22:43.370><c> it</c><00:22:43.870><c> there's</c><00:22:44.870><c> a</c><00:22:44.960><c> lot</c><00:22:45.200><c> of</c>

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
we try and analyze it there's a lot of
 

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.470 align:start position:0%
we try and analyze it there's a lot of
components<00:22:45.650><c> to</c><00:22:46.010><c> it</c><00:22:46.159><c> so</c><00:22:46.730><c> first</c><00:22:47.000><c> is</c><00:22:47.240><c> like</c>

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
components to it so first is like
 

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.140 align:start position:0%
components to it so first is like
companies<00:22:48.190><c> to</c><00:22:49.190><c> tread</c><00:22:49.490><c> a</c><00:22:49.520><c> lot</c><00:22:49.730><c> of</c><00:22:49.850><c> people</c>

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:50.150 align:start position:0%
companies to tread a lot of people
 

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
companies to tread a lot of people
around<00:22:50.210><c> here</c><00:22:50.480><c> and</c><00:22:50.720><c> I</c><00:22:50.780><c> think</c><00:22:50.990><c> like</c><00:22:51.440><c> really</c><00:22:51.799><c> the</c>

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.010 align:start position:0%

around here and I think like really the

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:53.450 align:start position:0%

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.060 align:start position:0%
average is somewhere around 10% it's
probably<00:22:53.809><c> getting</c><00:22:53.960><c> higher</c><00:22:54.289><c> particularly</c><00:22:54.710><c> if</c>

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:55.070 align:start position:0%
probably getting higher particularly if
 

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.680 align:start position:0%

you're in San Francisco it's getting
 

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.659 align:start position:0%
you're in San Francisco it's getting
