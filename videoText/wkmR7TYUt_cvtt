00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
then we're gonna do this order together
 

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.230 align:start position:0%
then we're gonna do this order together
so<00:13:46.040><c> that's</c><00:13:46.160><c> what</c><00:13:46.340><c> we</c><00:13:46.430><c> did</c><00:13:46.580><c> we</c><00:13:46.700><c> had</c><00:13:46.820><c> to</c><00:13:46.940><c> clear</c>

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
so that's what we did we had to clear
 

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.660 align:start position:0%
so that's what we did we had to clear

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:53.900 align:start position:0%
ways here to find those drinks this is
 

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.370 align:start position:0%
ways here to find those drinks this is
actually<00:13:54.320><c> us</c><00:13:54.820><c> packing</c><00:13:55.820><c> the</c><00:13:56.180><c> the</c><00:13:56.570><c> cards</c><00:13:56.990><c> the</c>

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:57.380 align:start position:0%
actually us packing the the cards the
 

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.350 align:start position:0%
actually us packing the the cards the

00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
trunk is already full at this point and
 

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
trunk is already full at this point and
so<00:13:59.660><c> this</c><00:13:59.810><c> is</c><00:13:59.960><c> the</c><00:14:00.140><c> the</c><00:14:00.320><c> back</c><00:14:00.500><c> seat</c><00:14:00.770><c> of</c><00:14:00.800><c> the</c><00:14:00.980><c> car</c>

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:01.630 align:start position:0%
so this is the the back seat of the car
