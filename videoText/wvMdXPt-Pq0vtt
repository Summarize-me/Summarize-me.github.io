we had this good growth curve but
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.660 align:start position:0%
we had this good growth curve but
another<00:01:03.480><c> way</c><00:01:03.600><c> to</c><00:01:03.660><c> get</c><00:01:03.809><c> to</c><00:01:03.960><c> do</c><00:01:04.350><c> that</c><00:01:04.379><c> is</c><00:01:04.670><c> donuts</c>

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 align:start position:0%

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 align:start position:0%
that there's this there's this weird
 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.969 align:start position:0%
that there's this there's this weird

and so that's quite good like like
 

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.329 align:start position:0%
and so that's quite good like like
effort<00:11:23.550><c> to</c><00:11:23.760><c> measure</c><00:11:23.940><c> I</c><00:11:24.240><c> think</c><00:11:24.950><c> the</c><00:11:25.950><c> the</c><00:11:26.310><c> real</c>

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
effort to measure I think the the real
 

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:27.829 align:start position:0%
effort to measure I think the the real
truth<00:11:26.519><c> with</c><00:11:26.970><c> the</c><00:11:27.060><c> growth</c><00:11:27.209><c> mindset</c><00:11:27.360><c> stuff</c><00:11:27.690><c> is</c>

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
truth with the growth mindset stuff is
 

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
truth with the growth mindset stuff is
that<00:11:27.959><c> like</c><00:11:28.079><c> the</c><00:11:28.230><c> output</c><00:11:28.620><c> measures</c><00:11:28.920><c> I</c><00:11:28.950><c> think</c>

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:29.250 align:start position:0%
that like the output measures I think
 

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.490 align:start position:0%
that like the output measures I think
are<00:11:29.640><c> like</c><00:11:29.959><c> from</c><00:11:30.959><c> what</c><00:11:31.050><c> we</c><00:11:31.140><c> can</c><00:11:31.230><c> tell</c><00:11:31.290><c> from</c>

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
are like from what we can tell from
 

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.889 align:start position:0%
are like from what we can tell from
research<00:11:31.829><c> they</c><00:11:32.070><c> like</c><00:11:32.250><c> take</c><00:11:32.490><c> a</c><00:11:32.519><c> bit</c><00:11:32.730><c> longer</c>

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:32.899 align:start position:0%
research they like take a bit longer
 

00:11:32.899 --> 00:11:35.329 align:start position:0%
research they like take a bit longer
thank<00:11:33.899><c> you</c><00:11:34.019><c> they're</c><00:11:34.200><c> mostly</c><00:11:34.589><c> like</c><00:11:34.740><c> psychology</c>

00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:36.650 align:start position:0%
thank you they're mostly like psychology
research<00:11:35.700><c> and</c><00:11:35.850><c> it</c><00:11:35.910><c> takes</c><00:11:36.120><c> a</c><00:11:36.209><c> bit</c><00:11:36.360><c> longer</c><00:11:36.390><c> to</c>

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
research and it takes a bit longer to
 

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
research and it takes a bit longer to
really<00:11:37.140><c> see</c><00:11:37.380><c> if</c><00:11:37.410><c> people's</c><00:11:37.769><c> mindsets</c><00:11:38.220><c> have</c>

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.370 align:start position:0%
really see if people's mindsets have
 

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
really see if people's mindsets have
changed<00:11:38.730><c> so</c><00:11:39.209><c> I</c><00:11:39.240><c> think</c><00:11:39.450><c> like</c><00:11:40.070><c> there's</c><00:11:41.070><c> this</c>

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:41.250 align:start position:0%
changed so I think like there's this
 

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.620 align:start position:0%
changed so I think like there's this
question<00:11:41.490><c> that</c><00:11:41.790><c> comes</c><00:11:41.940><c> up</c><00:11:42.120><c> a</c><00:11:42.240><c> lot</c><00:11:42.329><c> of</c><00:11:42.480><c> like</c>

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:42.630 align:start position:0%
question that comes up a lot of like
 

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.389 align:start position:0%
question that comes up a lot of like

should you do stuff that's like like
 

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.569 align:start position:0%
should you do stuff that's like like
high<00:11:46.050><c> efficacy</c><00:11:46.350><c> I</c><00:11:46.800><c> think</c><00:11:47.130><c> it's</c><00:11:47.250><c> actually</c><00:11:47.339><c> like</c>

00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
high efficacy I think it's actually like
 

00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
high efficacy I think it's actually like
a<00:11:47.670><c> false</c><00:11:47.880><c> trade-off</c><00:11:48.300><c> but</c><00:11:48.540><c> I</c><00:11:48.600><c> think</c><00:11:48.779><c> you</c><00:11:48.839><c> have</c>

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:48.930 align:start position:0%
a false trade-off but I think you have
 

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.259 align:start position:0%

00:31:57.989 --> 00:31:57.999 align:start position:0%
actually how you get them like how you
 

00:31:57.999 --> 00:31:59.310 align:start position:0%
actually how you get them like how you
get<00:31:58.179><c> the</c><00:31:58.269><c> most</c><00:31:58.480><c> from</c><00:31:58.600><c> people</c><00:31:58.779><c> is</c><00:31:59.019><c> when</c><00:31:59.169><c> people</c>

are like really bought in on a mission
 

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.249 align:start position:0%
are like really bought in on a mission
they<00:32:01.179><c> believe</c><00:32:01.480><c> in</c><00:32:01.600><c> and</c><00:32:01.749><c> they</c><00:32:01.809><c> feel</c><00:32:02.019><c> like</c><00:32:02.139><c> the</c>

00:32:02.249 --> 00:32:02.259 align:start position:0%
they believe in and they feel like the
 

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:03.629 align:start position:0%
they believe in and they feel like the

00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
owners of that mission and so I think
 

00:32:03.639 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
owners of that mission and so I think
