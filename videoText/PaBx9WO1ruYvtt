one<00:08:16.280><c> is</c><00:08:16.400><c> reverse</c><00:08:17.270><c> the</c><00:08:17.630><c> order</c><00:08:17.840><c> of</c>

one is reverse the order of
 

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.670 align:start position:0%
one is reverse the order of

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
conversations so now the most recent is
 

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.200 align:start position:0%

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:23.210 align:start position:0%
that at the bottom and not at the top
 

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.330 align:start position:0%
that at the bottom and not at the top
and<00:08:23.450><c> then</c><00:08:24.020><c> that</c><00:08:24.260><c> would</c><00:08:24.440><c> allow</c><00:08:24.830><c> us</c><00:08:24.860><c> who</c><00:08:25.220><c> have</c>

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:25.340 align:start position:0%
and then that would allow us who have
 

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:27.460 align:start position:0%
and then that would allow us who have

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.060 align:start position:0%

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.430 align:start position:0%

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.260 align:start position:0%

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
of what we did in the first two and a
half<00:14:42.960><c> years</c><00:14:43.200><c> which</c><00:14:43.830><c> is</c><00:14:44.030><c> how</c><00:14:45.030><c> many</c><00:14:45.090><c> customers</c>

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:45.450 align:start position:0%
half years which is how many customers
 

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.670 align:start position:0%
half years which is how many customers
roughly<00:14:46.220><c> so</c><00:14:47.220><c> it</c><00:14:47.730><c> got</c><00:14:48.000><c> us</c><00:14:48.150><c> to</c><00:14:48.300><c> probably</c><00:14:48.720><c> 1</c>

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
roughly so it got us to probably 1
 

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.410 align:start position:0%
roughly so it got us to probably 1
million<00:14:49.920><c> in</c><00:14:50.280><c> AR</c><00:14:50.700><c> and</c><00:14:51.270><c> so</c><00:14:51.990><c> that</c><00:14:52.320><c> was</c><00:14:52.500><c> probably</c><00:14:52.800><c> a</c>

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:53.420 align:start position:0%
million in AR and so that was probably a
 

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.660 align:start position:0%
million in AR and so that was probably a
thousand<00:14:54.420><c> customers</c><00:14:54.600><c> maybe</c><00:14:55.520><c> something</c><00:14:56.520><c> like</c>

think it's a super complex questions
 

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.269 align:start position:0%
think it's a super complex questions
because<00:25:23.460><c> if</c><00:25:23.700><c> the</c><00:25:23.909><c> answer</c><00:25:24.119><c> was</c><00:25:24.889><c> it's</c><00:25:25.889><c> now</c><00:25:26.009><c> let's</c>

00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
because if the answer was it's now let's
 

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:32.419 align:start position:0%
because if the answer was it's now let's
do<00:25:26.669><c> that</c><00:25:30.019><c> so</c><00:25:31.019><c> yeah</c><00:25:31.169><c> but</c><00:25:31.349><c> we</c><00:25:31.470><c> have</c><00:25:31.619><c> super</c><00:25:32.279><c> high</c>

00:25:32.419 --> 00:25:32.429 align:start position:0%
do that so yeah but we have super high
 

00:25:32.429 --> 00:25:36.230 align:start position:0%

truth is they will hire people like them
 

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.830 align:start position:0%
truth is they will hire people like them
and<00:27:21.710><c> so</c><00:27:22.310><c> then</c><00:27:22.760><c> if</c><00:27:22.970><c> you</c><00:27:23.060><c> don't</c><00:27:23.150><c> want</c><00:27:23.270><c> ten</c><00:27:23.570><c> people</c>

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
and so then if you don't want ten people
 

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.060 align:start position:0%
and so then if you don't want ten people
like<00:27:23.990><c> this</c><00:27:24.170><c> then</c><00:27:24.380><c> you</c><00:27:24.470><c> should</c><00:27:24.500><c> probably</c><00:27:24.770><c> not</c>

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.070 align:start position:0%
like this then you should probably not
 

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.430 align:start position:0%
like this then you should probably not
hire<00:27:25.250><c> this</c><00:27:25.460><c> person</c><00:27:25.550><c> and</c><00:27:26.180><c> so</c><00:27:26.810><c> I</c><00:27:26.840><c> think</c><00:27:27.050><c> we</c><00:27:27.290><c> did</c><00:27:27.350><c> a</c>

00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:23.419 align:start position:0%
launching yeah so I think there are a
 

00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:25.180 align:start position:0%
launching yeah so I think there are a
few<00:33:23.450><c> things</c><00:33:23.720><c> one</c><00:33:24.110><c> thing</c><00:33:24.230><c> that</c><00:33:24.440><c> I</c><00:33:24.470><c> always</c><00:33:24.830><c> find</c>

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.110 align:start position:0%
reason why I think we were successful
 

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.470 align:start position:0%
reason why I think we were successful
building<00:33:30.889><c> an</c><00:33:31.039><c> email</c><00:33:31.399><c> product</c><00:33:31.639><c> and</c><00:33:31.999><c> I</c><00:33:32.240><c> mean</c>

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:34.820 align:start position:0%
successful so far is because we actually
 

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.509 align:start position:0%
successful so far is because we actually
had<00:33:35.360><c> no</c><00:33:36.019><c> we</c><00:33:36.289><c> didn't</c><00:33:36.559><c> have</c><00:33:36.679><c> a</c><00:33:36.740><c> lot</c><00:33:36.950><c> of</c><00:33:37.039><c> insights</c>

wipe out most of the structural features
 

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
wipe out most of the structural features

you<00:39:43.680><c> have</c><00:39:43.830><c> a</c><00:39:43.860><c> subject</c><00:39:44.220><c> you</c><00:39:45.150><c> have</c><00:39:45.420><c> a</c><00:39:45.810><c> signature</c>

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
you have a subject you have a signature
 

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.770 align:start position:0%

you literally carbon copy and blank
 

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.500 align:start position:0%
you literally carbon copy and blank
carbon<00:39:49.230><c> could</c><00:39:49.410><c> be</c><00:39:49.680><c> and</c><00:39:49.890><c> so</c><00:39:50.580><c> I</c><00:39:50.820><c> think</c><00:39:51.090><c> I</c><00:39:51.360><c> would</c>

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:51.510 align:start position:0%

carbon could be and so I think I would

should CC BCC for reply all these things
but<00:39:58.440><c> I</c><00:39:58.800><c> would</c><00:39:59.100><c> keep</c><00:39:59.520><c> the</c><00:40:00.000><c> fact</c><00:40:00.210><c> that</c><00:40:00.350><c> it's</c>

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:01.350 align:start position:0%

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:04.250 align:start position:0%
but I would keep the fact that it's
Universal<00:40:01.650><c> and</c><00:40:02.220><c> you</c><00:40:03.120><c> can</c><00:40:03.330><c> have</c><00:40:03.840><c> a</c><00:40:03.870><c> message</c>

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
Universal and you can have a message
 

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.100 align:start position:0%
Universal and you can have a message
that's<00:40:04.590><c> being</c><00:40:04.830><c> sent</c><00:40:04.950><c> somewhere</c><00:40:05.490><c> else</c><00:40:06.110><c> and</c>

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:07.110 align:start position:0%
that's being sent somewhere else and
 

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.140 align:start position:0%
that's being sent somewhere else and
then<00:40:07.470><c> that's</c><00:40:08.130><c> what</c><00:40:08.280><c> I</c><00:40:08.310><c> would</c><00:40:08.550><c> do</c><00:40:08.670><c> so</c><00:40:08.850><c> I</c><00:40:08.880><c> would</c>

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:09.150 align:start position:0%
then that's what I would do so I would
 

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.470 align:start position:0%
then that's what I would do so I would
say<00:40:09.270><c> would</c><00:40:09.330><c> be</c><00:40:09.450><c> similar</c><00:40:09.780><c> to</c><00:40:09.840><c> SMS</c><00:40:11.180><c> yeah</c><00:40:12.180><c> but</c>

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
say would be similar to SMS yeah but
 

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.190 align:start position:0%
say would be similar to SMS yeah but
then<00:40:13.320><c> the</c><00:40:13.890><c> tricky</c><00:40:14.640><c> thing</c><00:40:14.820><c> is</c><00:40:14.850><c> SMS</c><00:40:15.540><c> is</c><00:40:15.660><c> zero</c>

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
then the tricky thing is SMS is zero
 

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.350 align:start position:0%
then the tricky thing is SMS is zero

like<00:40:37.920><c> are</c><00:40:38.100><c> used</c><00:40:38.670><c> as</c><00:40:39.080><c> workflows</c><00:40:40.080><c> yeah</c><00:40:40.620><c> whereas</c>

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:40.950 align:start position:0%
like are used as workflows yeah whereas
 

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.530 align:start position:0%
like are used as workflows yeah whereas
really<00:40:41.460><c> they're</c><00:40:41.580><c> not</c><00:40:41.730><c> designed</c><00:40:42.030><c> for</c><00:40:42.060><c> that</c><00:40:42.270><c> so</c>

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
really they're not designed for that so
 

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.670 align:start position:0%
really they're not designed for that so
then<00:40:42.720><c> that</c><00:40:42.870><c> leads</c><00:40:43.110><c> to</c><00:40:43.290><c> a</c><00:40:43.320><c> lot</c><00:40:43.470><c> of</c><00:40:43.500><c> in</c>

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
then that leads to a lot of in
 

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.190 align:start position:0%
then that leads to a lot of in
efficiencies<00:40:44.600><c> okay</c>

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
efficiencies okay
 

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
efficiencies okay
so<00:40:46.500><c> there</c><00:40:46.650><c> were</c><00:40:46.740><c> just</c><00:40:46.980><c> a</c><00:40:47.070><c> handful</c><00:40:47.370><c> of</c><00:40:47.460><c> other</c>

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:47.610 align:start position:0%

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
feel great yeah I've you know it was
 

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
feel great yeah I've you know it was
ultimately<00:41:28.320><c> a</c><00:41:28.560><c> good</c><00:41:28.710><c> investment</c><00:41:29.100><c> but</c><00:41:29.460><c> I</c>

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:29.850 align:start position:0%
ultimately a good investment but I
 

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:31.370 align:start position:0%
ultimately a good investment but I
didn't<00:41:30.270><c> feel</c><00:41:30.450><c> like</c><00:41:30.480><c> we</c><00:41:30.720><c> had</c><00:41:30.840><c> product</c><00:41:31.110><c> market</c>

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
didn't feel like we had product market
fit<00:41:31.410><c> yeah</c><00:41:31.860><c> and</c><00:41:32.370><c> I</c><00:41:32.550><c> think</c><00:41:32.820><c> when</c><00:41:33.180><c> we</c><00:41:33.210><c> raised</c><00:41:33.750><c> our</c>

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:33.930 align:start position:0%
fit yeah and I think when we raised our
 

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.890 align:start position:0%
fit yeah and I think when we raised our
series<00:41:34.440><c> a</c><00:41:34.590><c> and</c><00:41:34.860><c> so</c><00:41:35.520><c> we</c><00:41:35.550><c> raised</c><00:41:36.030><c> our</c><00:41:36.240><c> series</c><00:41:36.720><c> a</c>

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
series a and so we raised our series a
 

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
series a and so we raised our series a
we<00:41:37.200><c> were</c><00:41:37.380><c> making</c><00:41:38.190><c> I</c><00:41:38.640><c> think</c><00:41:39.380><c> 1.5</c><00:41:40.700><c> million</c><00:41:41.700><c> in</c><00:41:41.850><c> a</c>

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:42.090 align:start position:0%
we were making I think 1.5 million in a
 

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:46.970 align:start position:0%
we were making I think 1.5 million in a
are<00:41:43.040><c> so</c><00:41:44.040><c> a</c><00:41:44.070><c> little</c><00:41:44.370><c> bit</c><00:41:44.490><c> over</c><00:41:44.550><c> 100k</c><00:41:45.330><c> Mr</c><00:41:45.990><c> I</c><00:41:46.290><c> think</c>

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
are so a little bit over 100k Mr I think
 

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.820 align:start position:0%
are so a little bit over 100k Mr I think
that's<00:41:47.160><c> where</c><00:41:47.490><c> when</c><00:41:47.910><c> I</c><00:41:47.940><c> felt</c><00:41:48.390><c> like</c><00:41:48.990><c> some</c>

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:49.830 align:start position:0%
that's where when I felt like some
 

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.980 align:start position:0%
that's where when I felt like some
companies<00:41:50.310><c> were</c><00:41:50.760><c> using</c><00:41:51.300><c> the</c><00:41:51.450><c> product</c><00:41:51.780><c> and</c>

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:51.990 align:start position:0%
companies were using the product and
 

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
companies were using the product and
even<00:41:52.230><c> if</c><00:41:52.350><c> I</c><00:41:52.500><c> had</c><00:41:52.710><c> demoed</c><00:41:53.340><c> all</c><00:41:53.580><c> the</c><00:41:54.150><c> alternate</c>

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:54.810 align:start position:0%
even if I had demoed all the alternate
 

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:56.930 align:start position:0%
even if I had demoed all the alternate
yeah<00:41:55.290><c> front</c><00:41:56.250><c> was</c><00:41:56.400><c> actually</c><00:41:56.700><c> a</c><00:41:56.790><c> better</c>

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
yeah front was actually a better
 

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.570 align:start position:0%
yeah front was actually a better
solution<00:41:57.420><c> for</c><00:41:57.450><c> them</c><00:41:57.720><c> and</c><00:41:58.290><c> I</c><00:41:58.800><c> think</c><00:41:58.860><c> that's</c><00:41:59.220><c> and</c>

00:41:59.570 --> 00:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
solution for them and I think that's and
 

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.330 align:start position:0%
solution for them and I think that's and
then<00:41:59.790><c> I</c><00:42:00.120><c> felt</c><00:42:00.450><c> like</c><00:42:00.570><c> the</c><00:42:00.660><c> market</c><00:42:00.960><c> was</c><00:42:01.110><c> big</c><00:42:01.340><c> but</c>

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
then I felt like the market was big but
 

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.850 align:start position:0%
then I felt like the market was big but
didn't<00:42:02.670><c> really</c><00:42:02.880><c> know</c><00:42:03.000><c> how</c><00:42:03.210><c> big</c><00:42:03.480><c> but</c><00:42:03.840><c> at</c><00:42:04.710><c> least</c>

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
didn't really know how big but at least
 

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.910 align:start position:0%
didn't really know how big but at least
big<00:42:05.310><c> enough</c><00:42:05.660><c> and</c><00:42:06.660><c> I</c><00:42:06.810><c> think</c><00:42:06.840><c> so</c><00:42:07.230><c> that's</c><00:42:07.470><c> and</c><00:42:07.710><c> so</c>

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
big enough and I think so that's and so
 

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:11.660 align:start position:0%
big enough and I think so that's and so
that<00:42:08.100><c> was</c><00:42:08.310><c> in</c><00:42:08.970><c> in</c><00:42:09.920><c> three</c><00:42:10.920><c> years</c><00:42:11.130><c> after</c><00:42:11.550><c> we</c>

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:07.650 align:start position:0%
I think it was overwhelmed but I think
 

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.500 align:start position:0%
I think it was overwhelmed but I think
whether<00:45:07.770><c> I</c><00:45:07.890><c> was</c><00:45:08.130><c> over</c><00:45:08.430><c> 1</c><00:45:08.580><c> for</c><00:45:09.000><c> that</c><00:45:09.090><c> reason</c><00:45:09.420><c> or</c>

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:09.510 align:start position:0%
whether I was over 1 for that reason or
 

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.210 align:start position:0%
whether I was over 1 for that reason or
other<00:45:09.540><c> reasons</c><00:45:10.110><c> I</c><00:45:10.320><c> think</c><00:45:10.380><c> like</c><00:45:10.920><c> when</c><00:45:11.070><c> you're</c><00:45:11.190><c> a</c>

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
other reasons I think like when you're a
 

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:13.850 align:start position:0%
other reasons I think like when you're a
founder<00:45:11.670><c> in</c><00:45:11.880><c> draw</c><00:45:12.150><c> I</c><00:45:12.360><c> am</c><00:45:12.780><c> pretty</c><00:45:13.530><c> convinced</c>

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
founder in draw I am pretty convinced
 

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.340 align:start position:0%
founder in draw I am pretty convinced
that<00:45:13.950><c> 99.9%</c><00:45:14.940><c> of</c><00:45:15.330><c> founders</c><00:45:15.690><c> would</c><00:45:15.900><c> benefit</c>

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:16.350 align:start position:0%
that 99.9% of founders would benefit
 

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.130 align:start position:0%
that 99.9% of founders would benefit
from<00:45:16.410><c> meditating</c><00:45:16.950><c> every</c><00:45:17.160><c> day</c><00:45:17.780><c> so</c><00:45:18.780><c> that</c><00:45:18.990><c> was</c>

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
from meditating every day so that was
 

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.870 align:start position:0%
from meditating every day so that was
the<00:45:19.290><c> trigger</c><00:45:19.500><c> but</c><00:45:19.890><c> I</c><00:45:20.130><c> wish</c><00:45:20.370><c> I</c><00:45:20.520><c> had</c><00:45:20.700><c> known</c>

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
the trigger but I wish I had known
 

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.220 align:start position:0%
the trigger but I wish I had known
before<00:45:20.910><c> yeah</c>

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:22.230 align:start position:0%
before yeah
 

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.820 align:start position:0%
before yeah
so<00:45:22.920><c> the</c><00:45:23.820><c> the</c><00:45:24.420><c> good</c><00:45:24.540><c> thing</c><00:45:24.720><c> about</c><00:45:24.830><c> meditation</c>
