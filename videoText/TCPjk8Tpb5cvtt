i<00:12:32.639><c> mean</c><00:12:32.959><c> if</c><00:12:33.040><c> they</c><00:12:33.120><c> were</c><00:12:33.279><c> in</c><00:12:33.360><c> your</c><00:12:33.440><c> friends</c><00:12:33.680><c> list</c>

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
i mean if they were in your friends list
 

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
i mean if they were in your friends list
you<00:12:34.000><c> would</c><00:12:34.079><c> say</c><00:12:34.320><c> this</c><00:12:34.560><c> is</c><00:12:34.720><c> in</c><00:12:34.959><c> your</c><00:12:35.120><c> friends</c>

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
you would say this is in your friends
 

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.949 align:start position:0%
you would say this is in your friends
you<00:12:35.519><c> know</c><00:12:35.680><c> so</c><00:12:36.079><c> is</c><00:12:36.160><c> in</c><00:12:36.240><c> your</c><00:12:36.320><c> friends</c><00:12:36.560><c> list</c><00:12:36.800><c> and</c>

you know so is in your friends list and
 

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:38.629 align:start position:0%
you know so is in your friends list and
if<00:12:37.120><c> it</c><00:12:37.200><c> wasn't</c><00:12:37.519><c> it'd</c><00:12:37.680><c> say</c><00:12:38.000><c> so</c><00:12:38.160><c> and</c><00:12:38.240><c> so</c><00:12:38.480><c> is</c><00:12:38.560><c> in</c>

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't it'd say so and so is in
 

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't it'd say so and so is in
your<00:12:38.800><c> extended</c><00:12:39.200><c> network</c>

there<00:12:40.480><c> it</c><00:12:40.639><c> is</c><00:12:41.120><c> that</c><00:12:41.279><c> was</c><00:12:41.440><c> it</c><00:12:41.600><c> that</c><00:12:41.760><c> was</c><00:12:41.920><c> the</c>

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
there it is that was it that was the
 

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.670 align:start position:0%
there it is that was it that was the
feature

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%

and<00:12:43.839><c> so</c><00:12:44.480><c> so</c><00:12:44.720><c> friendster</c><00:12:45.120><c> was</c><00:12:45.279><c> like</c><00:12:45.440><c> trying</c><00:12:45.680><c> to</c>

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
and so so friendster was like trying to
 

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
and so so friendster was like trying to
like<00:12:46.079><c> hire</c><00:12:46.320><c> engineers</c><00:12:46.959><c> and</c><00:12:47.040><c> skill</c><00:12:47.360><c> my</c><00:12:47.600><c> sequel</c>

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.230 align:start position:0%
like hire engineers and skill my sequel
and<00:12:48.079><c> their</c><00:12:48.240><c> run</c><00:12:48.480><c> into</c><00:12:48.720><c> like</c><00:12:49.440><c> too</c><00:12:49.600><c> many</c><00:12:49.920><c> threads</c>

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
kernels and myspace was like uh
 

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.990 align:start position:0%
kernels and myspace was like uh
so-and-so<00:12:55.040><c> is</c><00:12:55.120><c> your</c><00:12:55.279><c> extended</c><00:12:55.680><c> network</c>

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
so-and-so is your extended network
 

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.230 align:start position:0%
so-and-so is your extended network
that's<00:12:56.240><c> our</c><00:12:56.399><c> solution</c><00:12:57.120><c> anyway</c><00:12:57.600><c> carry</c><00:12:57.839><c> on</c><00:12:58.000><c> that</c>

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's our solution anyway carry on that
 

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.990 align:start position:0%
that's our solution anyway carry on that
but<00:12:58.399><c> that's</c><00:12:58.720><c> same</c><00:12:58.959><c> deal</c>

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
but that's same deal
 

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.310 align:start position:0%
but that's same deal
so<00:13:00.399><c> our</c><00:13:00.720><c> second</c><00:13:01.040><c> one</c><00:13:01.200><c> was</c><00:13:01.600><c> um</c><00:13:01.920><c> it</c><00:13:02.000><c> would</c><00:13:02.160><c> always</c>

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
so our second one was um it would always
 

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.829 align:start position:0%
so our second one was um it would always
happen<00:13:02.560><c> with</c><00:13:02.639><c> popular</c><00:13:02.959><c> streamers</c><00:13:03.360><c> or</c><00:13:03.519><c> second</c>

00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
happen with popular streamers or second
 

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:05.590 align:start position:0%
happen with popular streamers or second
was<00:13:04.160><c> if</c><00:13:04.320><c> you</c><00:13:04.399><c> imagine</c>

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
available to do it and we saw all this
 

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.829 align:start position:0%
available to do it and we saw all this
great<00:15:56.160><c> tooling</c><00:15:56.480><c> to</c><00:15:56.560><c> do</c><00:15:56.639><c> it</c><00:15:56.720><c> for</c><00:15:56.880><c> video</c>

00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%

00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
was our free peering hack so
 

00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:10.470 align:start position:0%
was our free peering hack so
streaming<00:17:08.319><c> live</c><00:17:08.559><c> video</c><00:17:08.880><c> is</c><00:17:08.959><c> really</c><00:17:09.199><c> expensive</c>

back<00:17:10.799><c> then</c><00:17:11.039><c> it</c><00:17:11.199><c> was</c><00:17:11.439><c> really</c><00:17:11.839><c> expensive</c><00:17:12.480><c> and</c><00:17:12.640><c> we</c>

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
back then it was really expensive and we
 

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:14.710 align:start position:0%
back then it was really expensive and we
were<00:17:13.039><c> very</c><00:17:13.520><c> bad</c><00:17:13.760><c> fundraisers</c><00:17:14.400><c> that</c><00:17:14.559><c> was</c>

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
generating no revenue from it's like we
 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.230 align:start position:0%

into these like 40 different languages
and<00:19:25.360><c> they</c><00:19:25.440><c> were</c><00:19:25.600><c> like</c><00:19:26.000><c> infinite</c><00:19:26.320><c> money</c>

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
and they were like infinite money
 

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.470 align:start position:0%
and they were like infinite money
and<00:19:27.360><c> we're</c><00:19:27.440><c> like</c><00:19:27.600><c> we</c><00:19:27.760><c> don't</c><00:19:27.919><c> have</c><00:19:28.160><c> infinite</c>

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
money
 

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.029 align:start position:0%
money
and<00:19:29.679><c> so</c><00:19:29.840><c> i</c><00:19:29.919><c> think</c><00:19:30.080><c> we</c><00:19:30.240><c> stole</c><00:19:30.400><c> the</c><00:19:30.559><c> solution</c>

00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
and so i think we stole the solution
 

00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.310 align:start position:0%
and so i think we stole the solution
from<00:19:31.280><c> reddit</c>

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
from reddit
 

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.710 align:start position:0%
from reddit
um<00:19:33.039><c> we</c><00:19:33.200><c> were</c><00:19:33.360><c> like</c><00:19:33.679><c> what</c><00:19:33.919><c> happens</c><00:19:34.240><c> if</c><00:19:34.320><c> we</c><00:19:34.480><c> just</c>

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
um we were like what happens if we just
 

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
um we were like what happens if we just
build<00:19:34.960><c> a</c><00:19:35.039><c> little</c><00:19:35.440><c> website</c>

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
build a little website
 

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.150 align:start position:0%

where<00:19:37.039><c> our</c><00:19:37.200><c> community</c><00:19:37.679><c> translates</c>

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.430 align:start position:0%

everything

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
everything
 

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.950 align:start position:0%
everything
and<00:19:39.600><c> so</c><00:19:39.760><c> basically</c><00:19:40.160><c> it</c><00:19:40.240><c> would</c><00:19:40.480><c> just</c><00:19:40.720><c> like</c>
