doesn't really no going back at that
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.510 align:start position:0%
doesn't really no going back at that
point<00:00:42.960><c> and</c><00:00:43.230><c> it's</c><00:00:43.649><c> actually</c><00:00:43.980><c> surprisingly</c>

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
point and it's actually surprisingly
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.330 align:start position:0%
point and it's actually surprisingly

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
easy to run out of cash and we see many
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.569 align:start position:0%
easy to run out of cash and we see many
startups<00:00:47.879><c> not</c><00:00:48.149><c> realize</c><00:00:48.600><c> that</c><00:00:48.629><c> they</c><00:00:49.170><c> they</c><00:00:49.579><c> have</c>

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
done that until it's too late to
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
done that until it's too late to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 align:start position:0%
actually be able to turn it around and
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.650 align:start position:0%
actually be able to turn it around and
do<00:00:54.239><c> something</c><00:00:54.570><c> about</c><00:00:54.690><c> it</c>

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 align:start position:0%
do something about it
 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.799 align:start position:0%
do something about it
so<00:00:57.660><c> we're</c><00:00:57.780><c> going</c><00:00:57.870><c> to</c><00:00:57.960><c> talk</c><00:00:58.079><c> about</c><00:00:58.199><c> these</c><00:00:58.440><c> three</c>

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 align:start position:0%
so we're going to talk about these three
 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.569 align:start position:0%
so we're going to talk about these three
early-stage<00:01:00.809><c> pitfalls</c><00:01:01.530><c> so</c><00:01:01.800><c> this</c><00:01:02.100><c> is</c><00:01:02.250><c> probably</c>

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 align:start position:0%
early-stage pitfalls so this is probably
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.950 align:start position:0%
early-stage pitfalls so this is probably
most<00:01:03.650><c> relevant</c><00:01:04.650><c> to</c><00:01:05.549><c> you</c><00:01:05.729><c> right</c><00:01:06.000><c> now</c><00:01:06.210><c> and</c><00:01:06.540><c> then</c>

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
most relevant to you right now and then
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.539 align:start position:0%
most relevant to you right now and then
we'll<00:01:07.049><c> talk</c><00:01:07.200><c> through</c><00:01:07.409><c> another</c><00:01:07.710><c> three</c><00:01:08.040><c> that</c><00:01:08.340><c> as</c>

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 align:start position:0%
we'll talk through another three that as
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
we'll talk through another three that as
you<00:01:08.729><c> start</c><00:01:08.970><c> to</c><00:01:09.060><c> raise</c><00:01:09.210><c> money</c><00:01:09.450><c> and</c><00:01:09.570><c> are</c>

other other mistakes that companies make
 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
other other mistakes that companies make
so<00:01:14.700><c> we're</c><00:01:14.820><c> going</c><00:01:14.909><c> to</c><00:01:14.970><c> look</c><00:01:15.150><c> at</c><00:01:15.270><c> what</c><00:01:15.420><c> the</c>

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 align:start position:0%
so we're going to look at what the
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.060 align:start position:0%
so we're going to look at what the
numbers<00:01:15.869><c> you</c><00:01:16.140><c> should</c><00:01:16.170><c> be</c><00:01:16.380><c> looking</c><00:01:16.470><c> at</c><00:01:16.770><c> how</c>

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 align:start position:0%
numbers you should be looking at how
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.510 align:start position:0%
numbers you should be looking at how
often<00:01:17.250><c> you</c><00:01:17.490><c> should</c><00:01:17.520><c> be</c><00:01:17.729><c> looking</c><00:01:18.030><c> at</c><00:01:18.180><c> them</c>

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
often you should be looking at them
 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.190 align:start position:0%
often you should be looking at them
whether<00:01:20.520><c> your</c><00:01:20.700><c> expenses</c><00:01:21.240><c> are</c><00:01:21.360><c> realistic</c><00:01:21.689><c> and</c>

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
whether your expenses are realistic and
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 align:start position:0%
whether your expenses are realistic and
then<00:01:22.650><c> thinking</c><00:01:23.070><c> a</c><00:01:23.130><c> little</c><00:01:23.220><c> bit</c><00:01:23.369><c> more</c><00:01:23.640><c> about</c>

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 align:start position:0%

that you calculate that is you look at
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.730 align:start position:0%
that you calculate that is you look at

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 align:start position:0%
your average burn and that gives you a

to that you would hire a CPA an

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:09.980 align:start position:0%

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:28.970 align:start position:0%
so so why can you have any calculate it
 

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.500 align:start position:0%
so so why can you have any calculate it
I<00:26:29.030><c> mean</c><00:26:29.530><c> there</c><00:26:30.530><c> are</c><00:26:30.679><c> tools</c><00:26:30.950><c> online</c><00:26:31.510><c> personally</c>

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:32.510 align:start position:0%

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.789 align:start position:0%
I mean there are tools online personally
I<00:26:32.540><c> think</c><00:26:32.690><c> it's</c><00:26:32.929><c> actually</c><00:26:33.169><c> better</c><00:26:33.320><c> to</c><00:26:33.440><c> build</c><00:26:33.679><c> it</c>

00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:33.799 align:start position:0%
I think it's actually better to build it
 

00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:36.370 align:start position:0%
I think it's actually better to build it

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:36.380 align:start position:0%
yourself because I I think it makes you
 

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.010 align:start position:0%
yourself because I I think it makes you

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:39.020 align:start position:0%
think about it in your mind and so
 

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.850 align:start position:0%
think about it in your mind and so
usually<00:26:39.440><c> just</c><00:26:39.770><c> doing</c><00:26:40.010><c> good</c><00:26:40.820><c> old</c><00:26:40.970><c> spreadsheets</c>
