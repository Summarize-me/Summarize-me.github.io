00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.390 align:start position:0%
something to work in Linux and because I
you<00:05:06.080><c> know</c><00:05:06.139><c> everything</c><00:05:06.740><c> at</c><00:05:06.830><c> Intel</c><00:05:07.130><c> was</c><00:05:07.280><c> like</c>

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know everything at Intel was like
 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.060 align:start position:0%
you know everything at Intel was like
pretty<00:05:07.520><c> much</c><00:05:07.639><c> windows-based</c><00:05:08.470><c> and</c><00:05:09.470><c> so</c><00:05:09.919><c> that</c>

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
pretty much windows-based and so that
 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much windows-based and so that
was<00:05:10.220><c> my</c><00:05:10.250><c> criteria</c><00:05:10.699><c> when</c><00:05:11.210><c> looking</c><00:05:11.479><c> for</c><00:05:11.660><c> startup</c>

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 align:start position:0%
was my criteria when looking for startup
 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
was my criteria when looking for startup
so<00:05:12.169><c> it's</c><00:05:12.320><c> just</c><00:05:12.500><c> that</c><00:05:12.680><c> I</c><00:05:12.710><c> wanted</c><00:05:13.130><c> it</c><00:05:13.310><c> to</c><00:05:13.430><c> be</c><00:05:13.580><c> kind</c>

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 align:start position:0%
so it's just that I wanted it to be kind
 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.110 align:start position:0%
so it's just that I wanted it to be kind

00:34:02.419 --> 00:34:07.450 align:start position:0%
kind of go together and make sense yeah
yeah<00:34:03.260><c> i</c><00:34:03.289><c> i</c><00:34:04.659><c> think</c><00:34:05.659><c> like</c><00:34:05.929><c> focus</c><00:34:06.620><c> is</c><00:34:06.860><c> one</c><00:34:07.250><c> of</c><00:34:07.370><c> the</c>

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.550 align:start position:0%
start-up it's actually i think your most
powerful<00:34:11.330><c> weapon</c><00:34:11.629><c> right</c><00:34:12.109><c> like</c><00:34:12.260><c> the</c><00:34:12.409><c> reason</c>

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
powerful weapon right like the reason
 

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.099 align:start position:0%
powerful weapon right like the reason
that<00:34:12.800><c> you're</c><00:34:13.100><c> able</c><00:34:13.250><c> to</c><00:34:13.669><c> take</c><00:34:14.540><c> on</c><00:34:14.720><c> like</c><00:34:14.960><c> these</c>

00:34:15.099 --> 00:34:15.109 align:start position:0%
that you're able to take on like these
 

00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:16.389 align:start position:0%
that you're able to take on like these
big<00:34:15.290><c> companies</c><00:34:15.649><c> or</c><00:34:15.859><c> whoever</c><00:34:16.010><c> is</c><00:34:16.190><c> because</c>

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
big companies or whoever is because
 

00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
big companies or whoever is because
they're<00:34:16.580><c> doing</c><00:34:16.760><c> a</c><00:34:17.060><c> thousand</c><00:34:17.570><c> different</c>

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:17.690 align:start position:0%
they're doing a thousand different
 

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.930 align:start position:0%
they're doing a thousand different
things<00:34:17.869><c> right</c><00:34:18.710><c> and</c><00:34:18.919><c> so</c><00:34:19.070><c> the</c><00:34:19.159><c> only</c><00:34:19.460><c> way</c><00:34:19.609><c> you</c><00:34:19.669><c> can</c>

00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:19.940 align:start position:0%
things right and so the only way you can
 

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.210 align:start position:0%
things right and so the only way you can
win<00:34:20.149><c> is</c><00:34:20.389><c> if</c><00:34:20.570><c> you</c><00:34:20.690><c> take</c><00:34:20.929><c> everything</c><00:34:21.770><c> you</c><00:34:22.010><c> have</c>

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:22.220 align:start position:0%
win is if you take everything you have
 

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.950 align:start position:0%
win is if you take everything you have
and<00:34:22.369><c> you</c><00:34:22.460><c> focus</c><00:34:22.700><c> it</c><00:34:22.970><c> at</c><00:34:23.090><c> one</c><00:34:23.300><c> point</c><00:34:23.570><c> right</c>

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
and you focus it at one point right
 

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.379 align:start position:0%
and you focus it at one point right
because<00:34:24.169><c> you</c><00:34:24.350><c> you</c><00:34:25.250><c> are</c><00:34:25.280><c> underpowered</c><00:34:25.909><c> in</c>

00:34:26.379 --> 00:34:26.389 align:start position:0%
because you you are underpowered in
 

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:28.330 align:start position:0%
because you you are underpowered in
every<00:34:26.750><c> way</c><00:34:26.929><c> versus</c><00:34:27.440><c> these</c><00:34:27.770><c> other</c><00:34:27.919><c> companies</c>

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:28.340 align:start position:0%
every way versus these other companies
 

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.830 align:start position:0%
every way versus these other companies
so<00:34:28.490><c> the</c><00:34:28.609><c> one</c><00:34:28.730><c> thing</c><00:34:28.879><c> you</c><00:34:29.060><c> do</c><00:34:29.270><c> have</c><00:34:29.300><c> that</c><00:34:29.690><c> they</c>

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
so the one thing you do have that they
 

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.260 align:start position:0%
so the one thing you do have that they
don't<00:34:29.869><c> have</c><00:34:30.230><c> is</c><00:34:30.409><c> you</c><00:34:30.919><c> can</c><00:34:31.100><c> be</c><00:34:31.250><c> like</c><00:34:31.609><c> absolutely</c>

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:32.270 align:start position:0%
don't have is you can be like absolutely
 

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
don't have is you can be like absolutely
100%<00:34:32.869><c> focused</c><00:34:33.590><c> on</c><00:34:33.770><c> the</c><00:34:34.220><c> thing</c><00:34:34.429><c> that</c><00:34:34.609><c> you're</c>

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:34.730 align:start position:0%
100% focused on the thing that you're
 

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.099 align:start position:0%
100% focused on the thing that you're

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
more so like you give them money and
 

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%

the<00:37:56.870><c> reason</c><00:37:57.650><c> is</c><00:37:57.740><c> I</c><00:37:57.800><c> think</c><00:37:57.860><c> to</c><00:37:58.100><c> actually</c><00:37:58.460><c> get</c><00:37:58.610><c> it</c>

00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:58.730 align:start position:0%
the reason is I think to actually get it
 

00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
the reason is I think to actually get it
to<00:37:58.760><c> work</c><00:37:59.000><c> they</c><00:37:59.180><c> had</c><00:37:59.330><c> to</c><00:37:59.360><c> really</c><00:37:59.720><c> heavily</c>

00:37:59.920 --> 00:37:59.930 align:start position:0%
to work they had to really heavily
 

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
to work they had to really heavily
macerate<00:38:00.650><c> the</c><00:38:00.830><c> fruit</c><00:38:01.070><c> so</c><00:38:01.490><c> that's</c><00:38:01.640><c> why</c><00:38:01.730><c> I</c><00:38:01.790><c> call</c>

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:01.970 align:start position:0%
macerate the fruit so that's why I call
 

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:03.730 align:start position:0%
macerate the fruit so that's why I call
it<00:38:02.000><c> a</c><00:38:02.090><c> juice</c><00:38:02.300><c> bag</c><00:38:02.510><c> squeezer</c><00:38:02.930><c> because</c><00:38:03.560><c> it</c><00:38:03.650><c> was</c>

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:03.740 align:start position:0%
it a juice bag squeezer because it was

that<00:44:27.990><c> was</c><00:44:28.110><c> the</c><00:44:28.140><c> first</c><00:44:28.380><c> thing</c><00:44:28.620><c> out</c><00:44:28.740><c> of</c><00:44:28.800><c> two</c>

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
your question so how do you identify the
 

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
your question so how do you identify the
tipping<00:45:57.810><c> point</c><00:45:58.050><c> and</c><00:45:58.230><c> really</c><00:45:58.530><c> how</c><00:45:58.650><c> you</c><00:45:58.710><c> execute</c>

00:45:59.480 --> 00:45:59.490 align:start position:0%
tipping point and really how you execute
 

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
tipping point and really how you execute
that<00:45:59.730><c> tipping</c><00:46:00.210><c> point</c><00:46:00.270><c> that</c><00:46:01.080><c> gets</c><00:46:01.440><c> a</c><00:46:01.650><c> market</c><00:46:02.310><c> to</c>

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:02.730 align:start position:0%
that tipping point that gets a market to
 

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.270 align:start position:0%
that tipping point that gets a market to
that<00:46:02.940><c> so</c><00:46:03.930><c> the</c><00:46:04.200><c> question</c><00:46:04.320><c> is</c><00:46:04.710><c> how</c><00:46:05.130><c> do</c><00:46:05.190><c> you</c>

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
that so the question is how do you
 

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:13.150 align:start position:0%
that so the question is how do you
identify<00:46:05.400><c> a</c><00:46:05.820><c> tipping</c><00:46:06.450><c> point</c><00:46:06.480><c> for</c><00:46:06.750><c> a</c><00:46:06.900><c> market</c><00:46:10.640><c> I</c>

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
identify a tipping point for a market I
 

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
identify a tipping point for a market I
almost<00:46:14.160><c> feel</c><00:46:14.580><c> like</c><00:46:14.640><c> this</c><00:46:15.120><c> is</c><00:46:15.300><c> being</c><00:46:15.840><c> over</c>

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:28.170 align:start position:0%
and very profit the tipping point is
 

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
and very profit the tipping point is
when<00:46:28.380><c> you</c><00:46:28.470><c> can't</c><00:46:28.710><c> keep</c><00:46:28.859><c> up</c><00:46:29.040><c> with</c><00:46:29.069><c> demand</c>

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
don't find this by thinking about it if
 

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.170 align:start position:0%
don't find this by thinking about it if

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
you think about it too much you end up
 

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.510 align:start position:0%
you think about it too much you end up
just<00:46:36.210><c> like</c><00:46:36.690><c> in</c><00:46:36.930><c> delusional</c><00:46:37.559><c> land</c><00:46:37.800><c> you</c><00:46:38.250><c> find</c>

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:25.290 align:start position:0%
start-up like so the way I try to think
 

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
start-up like so the way I try to think
about<00:48:25.440><c> it</c><00:48:25.589><c> is</c><00:48:26.040><c> you</c><00:48:26.280><c> want</c><00:48:26.700><c> to</c><00:48:26.790><c> find</c><00:48:27.240><c> someone</c><00:48:28.049><c> who</c>

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:28.890 align:start position:0%
about it is you want to find someone who
 

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:32.510 align:start position:0%
about it is you want to find someone who
has<00:48:29.130><c> a</c><00:48:29.400><c> really</c><00:48:29.730><c> really</c><00:48:30.630><c> urgent</c><00:48:31.170><c> problem</c><00:48:31.920><c> right</c>

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
has a really really urgent problem right
 

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.609 align:start position:0%
has a really really urgent problem right
and<00:48:32.730><c> so</c><00:48:32.880><c> like</c><00:48:33.030><c> the</c><00:48:33.180><c> analogy</c><00:48:33.690><c> I</c><00:48:33.720><c> like</c><00:48:33.900><c> to</c><00:48:34.109><c> use</c><00:48:34.410><c> is</c>

00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
and so like the analogy I like to use is

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:55.990 align:start position:0%
up being the social network but it was
 

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
up being the social network but it was
exploding<00:52:57.510><c> and</c><00:52:58.510><c> then</c><00:52:58.930><c> it</c><00:52:59.200><c> became</c><00:52:59.650><c> it</c><00:52:59.920><c> was</c>

00:52:59.940 --> 00:52:59.950 align:start position:0%
exploding and then it became it was
 

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:01.310 align:start position:0%
exploding and then it became it was

00:53:01.310 --> 00:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
growing so fast it became unresponsive
 

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.990 align:start position:0%
growing so fast it became unresponsive
so<00:53:02.320><c> like</c><00:53:02.620><c> it</c><00:53:02.890><c> just</c><00:53:03.190><c> that</c><00:53:03.430><c> was</c><00:53:03.520><c> kind</c><00:53:03.760><c> of</c><00:53:03.790><c> why</c><00:53:03.940><c> it</c>

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
so like it just that was kind of why it
 

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.970 align:start position:0%
so like it just that was kind of why it
died<00:53:04.270><c> off</c><00:53:04.510><c> in</c><00:53:04.720><c> at</c><00:53:05.110><c> least</c><00:53:05.230><c> the</c><00:53:05.410><c> United</c><00:53:05.710><c> States</c>

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.750 align:start position:0%
died off in at least the United States
is<00:53:06.220><c> that</c><00:53:06.250><c> it</c><00:53:06.580><c> was</c>

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
is that it was
 

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
