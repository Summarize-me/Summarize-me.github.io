for<00:00:51.360><c> construction</c><00:00:52.000><c> you</c><00:00:52.239><c> basically</c><00:00:52.719><c> look</c><00:00:52.920><c> at</c>

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
for construction you basically look at
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.470 align:start position:0%
for construction you basically look at
the<00:00:53.320><c> blueprints</c><00:00:54.320><c> and</c><00:00:54.440><c> you</c><00:00:54.680><c> look</c><00:00:54.879><c> at</c><00:00:55.160><c> what</c><00:00:55.280><c> was</c>

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
the blueprints and you look at what was
 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.150 align:start position:0%
the blueprints and you look at what was
built<00:00:56.199><c> and</c><00:00:56.320><c> then</c><00:00:56.480><c> you</c><00:00:56.640><c> mark</c><00:00:56.920><c> down</c><00:00:57.079><c> the</c>

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
built and then you mark down the
 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.670 align:start position:0%
built and then you mark down the

right<00:18:21.080><c> and</c><00:18:21.480><c> so</c><00:18:22.480><c> so</c><00:18:22.720><c> you</c><00:18:22.840><c> know</c><00:18:23.360><c> uh</c><00:18:23.480><c> I</c><00:18:23.559><c> convinced</c>

00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
right and so so you know uh I convinced
 

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:25.270 align:start position:0%
right and so so you know uh I convinced
my<00:18:24.039><c> co-founders</c><00:18:24.520><c> that</c><00:18:24.679><c> this</c><00:18:24.799><c> was</c><00:18:24.960><c> going</c><00:18:25.039><c> to</c>

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
my co-founders that this was going to
 

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.390 align:start position:0%
my co-founders that this was going to
happen<00:18:25.880><c> and</c><00:18:26.000><c> so</c><00:18:26.120><c> we</c><00:18:26.240><c> started</c><00:18:26.679><c> hiding</c><00:18:27.200><c> the</c>

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
happen and so we started hiding the
 

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.230 align:start position:0%
happen and so we started hiding the
iPads<00:18:27.840><c> in</c><00:18:27.960><c> the</c><00:18:28.080><c> kitchen</c>

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
iPads in the kitchen
 

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
iPads in the kitchen
and<00:18:29.480><c> then</c><00:18:30.200><c> I</c><00:18:30.320><c> think</c><00:18:30.520><c> one</c><00:18:30.840><c> like</c><00:18:31.000><c> Ryan</c><00:18:31.280><c> put</c><00:18:31.440><c> it</c><00:18:31.559><c> in</c>

00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
