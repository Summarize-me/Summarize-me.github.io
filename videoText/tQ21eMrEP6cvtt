00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
basically in projection were interested
 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.670 align:start position:0%
basically in projection were interested
in<00:06:49.580><c> this</c><00:06:49.850><c> very</c><00:06:50.120><c> large</c><00:06:50.540><c> physical</c><00:06:50.930><c> scale</c>

in this very large physical scale
 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
in this very large physical scale
already<00:06:52.120><c> so</c><00:06:53.120><c> they</c><00:06:53.330><c> they</c><00:06:53.570><c> booked</c><00:06:53.840><c> it</c><00:06:54.020><c> but</c><00:06:54.230><c> again</c>

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 align:start position:0%
already so they they booked it but again
 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
already so they they booked it but again
I<00:06:54.560><c> guess</c><00:06:55.130><c> part</c><00:06:55.490><c> of</c><00:06:55.639><c> it</c><00:06:55.730><c> is</c><00:06:55.940><c> that</c><00:06:56.210><c> some</c><00:06:56.389><c> of</c><00:06:56.480><c> these</c>

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:56.570 align:start position:0%
I guess part of it is that some of these
 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.450 align:start position:0%
I guess part of it is that some of these
artists<00:06:56.960><c> were</c><00:06:57.050><c> already</c><00:06:57.350><c> quite</c><00:06:57.620><c> prominent</c><00:06:58.280><c> and</c>

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 align:start position:0%

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:30.890 align:start position:0%
really become a member you just signed
 

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.909 align:start position:0%
really become a member you just signed
you<00:08:31.430><c> fill</c><00:08:31.760><c> out</c><00:08:31.880><c> a</c><00:08:31.910><c> form</c><00:08:32.300><c> and</c><00:08:32.630><c> you</c><00:08:33.320><c> sent</c><00:08:33.589><c> it</c><00:08:33.740><c> in</c>

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
you fill out a form and you sent it in
 

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.060 align:start position:0%
you fill out a form and you sent it in

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:37.070 align:start position:0%
and so at their peak by around 1970 they
 

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.540 align:start position:0%
and so at their peak by around 1970 they

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:40.550 align:start position:0%
had nearly 5,000 members what did it
 

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.700 align:start position:0%
had nearly 5,000 members what did it
mean<00:08:40.729><c> to</c><00:08:40.760><c> be</c><00:08:40.909><c> a</c><00:08:40.940><c> member</c><00:08:41.270><c> so</c><00:08:41.960><c> basically</c><00:08:42.500><c> to</c><00:08:42.589><c> be</c><00:08:42.680><c> a</c>

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:42.710 align:start position:0%
mean to be a member so basically to be a
 

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
mean to be a member so basically to be a

taking that as far as you might even
 

00:16:23.779 --> 00:16:28.300 align:start position:0%
taking that as far as you might even
yeah<00:16:24.320><c> go</c><00:16:25.160><c> so</c><00:16:25.880><c> that</c><00:16:26.690><c> was</c><00:16:26.959><c> also</c><00:16:27.199><c> part</c><00:16:27.620><c> of</c><00:16:27.709><c> why</c><00:16:27.949><c> I</c>

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:28.310 align:start position:0%
yeah go so that was also part of why I
 

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.420 align:start position:0%
yeah go so that was also part of why I
think<00:16:28.339><c> EA</c><00:16:28.850><c> T</c><00:16:28.910><c> had</c><00:16:29.420><c> a</c><00:16:29.449><c> very</c><00:16:30.430><c> conflicted</c>

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:33.470 align:start position:0%
reception at the time and why maybe
 

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.559 align:start position:0%
reception at the time and why maybe

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
to the automation house but like I have
so<00:16:57.110><c> what</c><00:16:57.680><c> was</c><00:16:57.800><c> it</c><00:16:57.949><c> exactly</c><00:16:58.069><c> do</c><00:16:58.430><c> you</c><00:16:58.459><c> see</c><00:16:58.760><c> that</c>

00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
so what was it exactly do you see that
 

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.420 align:start position:0%
so what was it exactly do you see that
part<00:16:59.089><c> of</c><00:16:59.149><c> the</c><00:16:59.209><c> video</c><00:16:59.269><c> no</c><00:16:59.690><c> it</c><00:16:59.839><c> isn't</c><00:17:00.139><c> crazy</c><00:17:00.500><c> ok</c>

part of the video no it isn't crazy ok
so<00:17:01.940><c> what</c><00:17:02.360><c> is</c><00:17:02.449><c> it</c><00:17:02.569><c> actually</c><00:17:02.990><c> called</c><00:17:03.230><c> au</c>

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
so what is it actually called au
 

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.020 align:start position:0%
so what is it actually called au
automated<00:17:04.760><c> house</c><00:17:05.120><c> it's</c><00:17:05.270><c> called</c><00:17:06.699><c> this</c><00:17:07.699><c> is</c><00:17:07.760><c> like</c>

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:08.030 align:start position:0%
automated house it's called this is like
 

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.740 align:start position:0%
automated house it's called this is like
they're<00:17:09.040><c> the</c><00:17:10.040><c> collaboration</c><00:17:10.939><c> between</c><00:17:10.970><c> I</c>

they're the collaboration between I
 

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.059 align:start position:0%
they're the collaboration between I
think<00:17:11.809><c> I</c><00:17:12.169><c> got</c><00:17:12.350><c> this</c><00:17:12.439><c> right</c><00:17:12.589><c> American</c>

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:13.069 align:start position:0%
think I got this right American

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:18.470 align:start position:0%
was called or in technology is all very
 

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.620 align:start position:0%
was called or in technology is all very
confusing<00:28:18.679><c> yeah</c><00:28:19.250><c> but</c><00:28:19.940><c> it</c><00:28:20.000><c> was</c><00:28:20.120><c> basically</c><00:28:20.480><c> a</c>

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:20.630 align:start position:0%
confusing yeah but it was basically a
 

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.570 align:start position:0%

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:22.580 align:start position:0%
for an exhibition so they were very much
 

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
for an exhibition so they were very much
inspired<00:28:22.970><c> by</c><00:28:23.090><c> EA</c><00:28:23.330><c> T</c><00:28:23.450><c> but</c><00:28:23.870><c> this</c><00:28:24.350><c> exhibition</c><00:28:25.330><c> was</c>

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:26.330 align:start position:0%
inspired by EA T but this exhibition was
 

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:27.549 align:start position:0%
inspired by EA T but this exhibition was
sort<00:28:26.480><c> of</c><00:28:26.539><c> like</c><00:28:26.630><c> the</c><00:28:26.720><c> endpoint</c><00:28:27.140><c> so</c><00:28:27.380><c> in</c><00:28:27.470><c> other</c>

00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
sort of like the endpoint so in other
 

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
sort of like the endpoint so in other
words<00:28:27.799><c> you</c><00:28:28.549><c> would</c><00:28:28.700><c> Commission</c><00:28:29.030><c> all</c><00:28:29.240><c> these</c>

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
words you would Commission all these

one one project yeah we cuz you get the

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.010 align:start position:0%

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
again what I would say is that it's an
 

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.330 align:start position:0%
again what I would say is that it's an
incredibly<00:42:44.940><c> well</c><00:42:45.840><c> it's</c><00:42:46.590><c> a</c><00:42:46.710><c> very</c><00:42:46.860><c> intuitive</c>

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
incredibly well it's a very intuitive
 

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly well it's a very intuitive
but<00:42:47.730><c> it's</c><00:42:47.850><c> also</c><00:42:47.970><c> a</c><00:42:48.150><c> perverse</c><00:42:48.630><c> idea</c><00:42:49.110><c> because</c><00:42:49.380><c> I</c>

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:49.410 align:start position:0%
but it's also a perverse idea because I
 

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.890 align:start position:0%
but it's also a perverse idea because I

yeah and that's been something that
again<00:43:21.330><c> actually</c><00:43:22.070><c> you</c><00:43:23.070><c> could</c><00:43:23.220><c> say</c><00:43:23.370><c> almost</c><00:43:23.520><c> the</c>

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:23.730 align:start position:0%
again actually you could say almost the

entire history of Modern Art is about

entire history of Modern Art is about

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:30.050 align:start position:0%

and<00:43:27.840><c> so</c><00:43:28.170><c> we've</c><00:43:28.320><c> been</c><00:43:28.470><c> through</c><00:43:28.740><c> in</c><00:43:29.100><c> our</c><00:43:29.370><c> sort</c><00:43:30.030><c> of</c>

and so we've been through in our sort of
 

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.300 align:start position:0%
and so we've been through in our sort of

people trying to test this in different

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:36.870 align:start position:0%

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.140 align:start position:0%

right<00:43:37.170><c> it's</c><00:43:37.440><c> like</c><00:43:37.560><c> saying</c><00:43:38.400><c> that</c><00:43:38.580><c> it's</c>

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:39.150 align:start position:0%

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.290 align:start position:0%
think it's also really today it's

00:58:50.290 --> 00:58:50.300 align:start position:0%
absolutely applicable and I think it's
 

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.790 align:start position:0%

you<00:58:51.140><c> know</c><00:58:53.020><c> part</c><00:58:54.020><c> of</c><00:58:54.109><c> what</c><00:58:54.170><c> this</c><00:58:54.410><c> is</c><00:58:54.619><c> is</c><00:58:54.770><c> a</c>

you know part of what this is is a

you know part of what this is is a

thought of but never came to pass and I
 

00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:02.589 align:start position:0%
thought of but never came to pass and I

00:59:02.589 --> 00:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
think you know in our culture we're
 

00:59:02.599 --> 00:59:04.510 align:start position:0%
think you know in our culture we're
often<00:59:02.810><c> taught</c><00:59:03.200><c> if</c><00:59:03.710><c> it</c><00:59:04.069><c> wasn't</c><00:59:04.400><c> successful</c>

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
often taught if it wasn't successful
 

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
often taught if it wasn't successful
then<00:59:05.000><c> you</c><00:59:05.119><c> shouldn't</c><00:59:05.390><c> pay</c><00:59:05.510><c> attention</c><00:59:05.540><c> to</c><00:59:06.140><c> it</c>

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:06.290 align:start position:0%
then you shouldn't pay attention to it
 

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:08.380 align:start position:0%
then you shouldn't pay attention to it
but<00:59:06.710><c> actually</c><00:59:07.250><c> I</c><00:59:07.460><c> think</c><00:59:07.550><c> the</c><00:59:07.819><c> opposite</c><00:59:08.240><c> is</c>

00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
but actually I think the opposite is
 

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:10.750 align:start position:0%
but actually I think the opposite is
true<00:59:08.740><c> because</c><00:59:09.740><c> then</c><00:59:09.859><c> you'll</c><00:59:09.980><c> never</c><00:59:10.190><c> know</c><00:59:10.430><c> what</c>

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
true because then you'll never know what
 

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.700 align:start position:0%
true because then you'll never know what
still<00:59:11.510><c> might</c><00:59:11.630><c> be</c><00:59:11.660><c> possible</c><00:59:12.170><c> in</c><00:59:12.410><c> the</c><00:59:12.530><c> future</c>

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:12.710 align:start position:0%
still might be possible in the future
 

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:14.740 align:start position:0%
still might be possible in the future
and<00:59:13.010><c> so</c><00:59:13.099><c> you</c><00:59:13.190><c> have</c><00:59:13.369><c> to</c><00:59:13.520><c> explore</c><00:59:13.910><c> all</c><00:59:14.390><c> of</c><00:59:14.450><c> these</c>

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:14.750 align:start position:0%

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:17.620 align:start position:0%
