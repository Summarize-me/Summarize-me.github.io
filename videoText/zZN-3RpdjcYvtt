00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
loved genetics was my first investment
 

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
loved genetics was my first investment
in<00:08:05.040><c> 1996</c><00:08:05.750><c> and</c><00:08:06.750><c> so</c><00:08:06.900><c> in</c><00:08:07.020><c> some</c><00:08:07.260><c> ways</c><00:08:07.380><c> it</c><00:08:07.470><c> was</c><00:08:07.500><c> my</c>

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:07.650 align:start position:0%
in 1996 and so in some ways it was my

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:10.230 align:start position:0%

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.170 align:start position:0%

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:15.090 align:start position:0%
when I started investing there was the

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%

you tell them like here's what you need
to<00:27:06.560><c> do</c><00:27:06.680><c> to</c><00:27:06.770><c> have</c><00:27:06.860><c> a</c><00:27:06.920><c> good</c><00:27:07.040><c> shot</c><00:27:07.220><c> at</c><00:27:07.310><c> that</c><00:27:07.370><c> means</c>

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
to do to have a good shot at that means
 

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.010 align:start position:0%
to do to have a good shot at that means
100<00:27:07.670><c> so</c><00:27:08.060><c> that's</c><00:27:08.270><c> one</c><00:27:08.570><c> of</c><00:27:08.660><c> the</c><00:27:08.750><c> things</c><00:27:08.870><c> that's</c>

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:09.020 align:start position:0%
100 so that's one of the things that's
 

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.020 align:start position:0%
100 so that's one of the things that's
most<00:27:09.200><c> exciting</c><00:27:09.410><c> is</c><00:27:09.860><c> like</c><00:27:10.010><c> what</c><00:27:10.310><c> we</c><00:27:10.460><c> can</c><00:27:10.670><c> do</c><00:27:10.820><c> by</c>

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:11.030 align:start position:0%
most exciting is like what we can do by
 

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.090 align:start position:0%
most exciting is like what we can do by
having<00:27:11.450><c> a</c><00:27:11.570><c> community</c><00:27:11.750><c> of</c><00:27:12.110><c> people</c><00:27:12.380><c> who</c><00:27:12.560><c> are</c><00:27:12.740><c> all</c>

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:15.680 align:start position:0%

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.450 align:start position:0%
call these intervention studies so we
 

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.260 align:start position:0%
call these intervention studies so we

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:20.270 align:start position:0%
did our first one on weight loss so we
 

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
did our first one on weight loss so we
had<00:27:20.390><c> 70,000</c><00:27:21.110><c> people</c><00:27:21.820><c> doing</c><00:27:22.820><c> you</c><00:27:23.060><c> know</c><00:27:23.150><c> a</c><00:27:23.180><c> six</c>
