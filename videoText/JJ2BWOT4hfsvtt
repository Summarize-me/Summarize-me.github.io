like unambiguously did you guys hit it
at<00:13:24.830><c> Socialcam</c><00:13:25.339><c> I</c><00:13:26.200><c> would</c><00:13:27.200><c> say</c><00:13:27.410><c> yes</c><00:13:27.710><c> and</c><00:13:27.980><c> no</c><00:13:28.070><c> I</c>

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:28.670 align:start position:0%
at Socialcam I would say yes and no I
 

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.810 align:start position:0%
at Socialcam I would say yes and no I
would<00:13:29.149><c> say</c><00:13:29.450><c> that</c><00:13:29.860><c> we</c><00:13:30.860><c> definitely</c><00:13:31.339><c> got</c><00:13:31.460><c> hit</c><00:13:31.700><c> in</c>

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:31.820 align:start position:0%
would say that we definitely got hit in
 

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
would say that we definitely got hit in
the<00:13:31.910><c> face</c><00:13:32.060><c> with</c><00:13:32.120><c> growth</c><00:13:33.310><c> however</c><00:13:34.310><c> I</c><00:13:34.370><c> would</c><00:13:34.580><c> say</c>

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:34.730 align:start position:0%
the face with growth however I would say
 

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.550 align:start position:0%
the face with growth however I would say
that<00:13:34.760><c> we</c><00:13:35.060><c> were</c><00:13:35.240><c> particularly</c><00:13:36.170><c> good</c><00:13:36.350><c> at</c>

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
that we were particularly good at
 

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.350 align:start position:0%
that we were particularly good at
distribution<00:13:37.339><c> and</c><00:13:37.520><c> not</c><00:13:37.760><c> as</c><00:13:37.910><c> good</c><00:13:38.060><c> a</c><00:13:38.089><c> product</c>

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
distribution and not as good a product
 

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.750 align:start position:0%
distribution and not as good a product
and<00:13:38.690><c> so</c><00:13:39.410><c> I</c><00:13:39.680><c> would</c><00:13:39.890><c> say</c><00:13:40.070><c> that</c><00:13:40.250><c> our</c><00:13:40.279><c> product</c>

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
and so I would say that our product
 

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.630 align:start position:0%
and so I would say that our product
didn't<00:13:40.970><c> retain</c><00:13:41.209><c> as</c><00:13:41.390><c> well</c><00:13:41.540><c> as</c><00:13:41.630><c> we</c><00:13:41.720><c> wanted</c><00:13:41.930><c> to</c>

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
didn't retain as well as we wanted to
 

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.070 align:start position:0%
didn't retain as well as we wanted to
but<00:13:43.640><c> we</c><00:13:43.760><c> certainly</c><00:13:43.940><c> got</c><00:13:44.149><c> a</c><00:13:44.209><c> ton</c><00:13:44.390><c> of</c><00:13:44.420><c> growth</c><00:13:44.690><c> and</c>

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:45.080 align:start position:0%
but we certainly got a ton of growth and
 

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.290 align:start position:0%
but we certainly got a ton of growth and
I<00:13:45.170><c> think</c><00:13:45.380><c> that</c><00:13:45.560><c> you</c><00:13:45.740><c> know</c><00:13:45.830><c> in</c><00:13:46.040><c> social</c><00:13:46.339><c> you</c><00:13:47.089><c> see</c>

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:47.300 align:start position:0%
I think that you know in social you see
 

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.990 align:start position:0%
I think that you know in social you see
that<00:13:47.450><c> happen</c><00:13:47.779><c> and</c><00:13:47.899><c> I'd</c><00:13:48.170><c> argue</c><00:13:48.380><c> that</c><00:13:48.529><c> like</c><00:13:49.000><c> you</c>

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
that happen and I'd argue that like you
 

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
that happen and I'd argue that like you

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:54.529 align:start position:0%
I would probably say no I probably say
 

00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:56.110 align:start position:0%
I would probably say no I probably say

the things I think about is that when
 

00:24:04.749 --> 00:24:07.529 align:start position:0%
the things I think about is that when

you're iterating usually there's lots of
 

00:24:07.539 --> 00:24:09.930 align:start position:0%
you're iterating usually there's lots of

you're solving the same problem or very

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
and so for me like I get smarter every
 

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:26.889 align:start position:0%
and so for me like I get smarter every

00:24:34.299 --> 00:24:34.309 align:start position:0%
to me pivoting is when you basically
 

00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:37.090 align:start position:0%
to me pivoting is when you basically
take<00:24:34.669><c> things</c><00:24:35.000><c> outside</c><00:24:35.269><c> of</c><00:24:35.720><c> your</c><00:24:36.080><c> realm</c><00:24:36.289><c> of</c><00:24:36.529><c> the</c>

I<00:26:03.049><c> think</c><00:26:03.649><c> another</c><00:26:03.830><c> pivoting</c><00:26:04.730><c> problem</c><00:26:05.029><c> is</c><00:26:05.179><c> that</c>

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:05.330 align:start position:0%
I think another pivoting problem is that
 

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
I think another pivoting problem is that
people<00:26:05.509><c> pivot</c><00:26:06.440><c> and</c><00:26:06.649><c> apply</c><00:26:06.919><c> the</c><00:26:06.980><c> same</c><00:26:07.669><c> solution</c>

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:08.330 align:start position:0%
people pivot and apply the same solution
 

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.999 align:start position:0%
people pivot and apply the same solution
to<00:26:08.480><c> multiple</c><00:26:08.899><c> problems</c><00:26:09.440><c> and</c><00:26:09.740><c> like</c><00:26:09.860><c> the</c>

00:26:09.999 --> 00:26:10.009 align:start position:0%
to multiple problems and like the
 

00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:12.310 align:start position:0%
to multiple problems and like the
solution<00:26:10.309><c> is</c><00:26:10.580><c> just</c><00:26:10.759><c> never</c><00:26:10.879><c> that</c><00:26:11.120><c> good</c><00:26:11.360><c> and</c><00:26:12.049><c> so</c>

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
solution is just never that good and so
 

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
solution is just never that good and so
you<00:26:12.379><c> just</c><00:26:12.590><c> get</c><00:26:12.769><c> locked</c><00:26:13.009><c> into</c><00:26:13.190><c> this</c><00:26:13.340><c> thing</c><00:26:13.580><c> that</c>
