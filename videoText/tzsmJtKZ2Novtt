i'll<00:11:35.440><c> guess</c><00:11:35.680><c> that</c><00:11:35.839><c> it's</c><00:11:36.000><c> not</c><00:11:36.320><c> as</c><00:11:36.560><c> good</c><00:11:36.720><c> of</c><00:11:36.880><c> a</c>

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
i'll guess that it's not as good of a

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
good enough that microsoft could
 

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.310 align:start position:0%
good enough that microsoft could

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
actually use that like massive sales

do you guys think about that if you have

do you guys think about that if you have

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
a structural advantage but you bring a

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
right and like you know we saw that
 

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.910 align:start position:0%
right and like you know we saw that
microsoft's<00:11:56.800><c> done</c><00:11:56.959><c> that</c><00:11:57.200><c> too</c><00:11:57.440><c> right</c><00:11:57.680><c> their</c>

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
microsoft's done that too right their

so a structural advantage with the crap
product<00:12:04.399><c> doesn't</c><00:12:04.720><c> win</c>

a structural advantage with a product
 

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
a structural advantage with a product
that's<00:12:07.600><c> good</c><00:12:07.839><c> enough</c><00:12:08.160><c> can</c><00:12:08.399><c> win</c><00:12:09.040><c> and</c><00:12:09.200><c> man</c><00:12:09.519><c> it</c>

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's good enough can win and man it
 

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.150 align:start position:0%
that's good enough can win and man it
really<00:12:10.079><c> helps</c><00:12:10.399><c> when</c><00:12:10.639><c> some</c><00:12:10.959><c> startup</c><00:12:11.519><c> specs</c><00:12:12.000><c> the</c>

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
right like microsoft's move is to not
 

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.670 align:start position:0%
right like microsoft's move is to not

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
innovate the good enough product it's to
 

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.949 align:start position:0%
innovate the good enough product it's to
copy<00:12:18.079><c> it</c>

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
copy it
 

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:21.350 align:start position:0%
copy it
like<00:12:19.680><c> maybe</c><00:12:20.000><c> five</c><00:12:20.240><c> to</c><00:12:20.320><c> ten</c><00:12:20.480><c> years</c><00:12:20.720><c> later</c><00:12:21.120><c> and</c>

like maybe five to ten years later and

like maybe five to ten years later and

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
so that is something to be worried about
 

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:25.269 align:start position:0%
so that is something to be worried about
but<00:12:23.760><c> weirdly</c>

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%

trying to find examples of times that
like

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.430 align:start position:0%
like
a<00:12:41.360><c> fang</c><00:12:41.760><c> company</c><00:12:42.240><c> launched</c><00:12:42.560><c> a</c><00:12:42.720><c> product</c><00:12:43.120><c> that</c>

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
a fang company launched a product that
 

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.230 align:start position:0%
a fang company launched a product that

killed a fast-growing successful startup
 

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.629 align:start position:0%
killed a fast-growing successful startup
