my friends and asking my old lab can we

my friends and asking my old lab can we
use<00:04:31.200><c> your</c><00:04:31.230><c> infrastructure</c><00:04:32.070><c> and</c><00:04:32.480><c> it</c><00:04:33.480><c> was</c><00:04:33.630><c> just</c>

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
use your infrastructure and it was just
 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
use your infrastructure and it was just

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 align:start position:0%
incredibly inefficient also actually the
 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.380 align:start position:0%
incredibly inefficient also actually the

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 align:start position:0%
the inefficiency drives a lot of
 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.390 align:start position:0%
the inefficiency drives a lot of

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
inefficiency and pricing in the market
 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
inefficiency and pricing in the market
so<00:04:41.910><c> that</c><00:04:42.060><c> was</c><00:04:42.210><c> something</c><00:04:42.540><c> that</c><00:04:42.570><c> was</c><00:04:42.840><c> a</c><00:04:42.900><c> big</c><00:04:43.260><c> a</c>

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 align:start position:0%
so that was something that was a big a
 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.090 align:start position:0%
so that was something that was a big a

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
big learning point for me at that time
 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.830 align:start position:0%
big learning point for me at that time
point<00:04:47.460><c> was</c><00:04:47.670><c> you</c><00:04:47.970><c> could</c><00:04:48.180><c> actually</c><00:04:48.360><c> create</c><00:04:48.720><c> a</c>

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
point was you could actually create a
 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
point was you could actually create a
company<00:04:49.350><c> that</c><00:04:49.590><c> had</c><00:04:49.800><c> margin</c><00:04:50.340><c> in</c><00:04:50.520><c> that</c><00:04:50.670><c> space</c>

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 align:start position:0%
company that had margin in that space
 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.970 align:start position:0%
company that had margin in that space
because<00:04:51.270><c> the</c><00:04:52.110><c> market</c><00:04:52.440><c> was</c><00:04:52.560><c> so</c><00:04:52.710><c> inefficient</c>

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
because the market was so inefficient
 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
because the market was so inefficient
due<00:04:53.640><c> to</c><00:04:53.730><c> the</c><00:04:53.820><c> lack</c><00:04:53.970><c> of</c><00:04:54.000><c> information</c><00:04:54.360><c> so</c><00:04:55.260><c> for</c>

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 align:start position:0%
due to the lack of information so for

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:52.430 align:start position:0%
challenging because you don't control
 

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.940 align:start position:0%
challenging because you don't control
really<00:11:52.940><c> the</c><00:11:53.240><c> success</c><00:11:53.660><c> of</c><00:11:53.990><c> the</c><00:11:54.470><c> business</c><00:11:54.590><c> so</c>

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:54.950 align:start position:0%
really the success of the business so
 

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
really the success of the business so
you<00:11:55.010><c> don't</c><00:11:55.100><c> I</c><00:11:55.400><c> mean</c><00:11:55.760><c> you</c><00:11:56.030><c> do</c><00:11:56.180><c> but</c><00:11:56.420><c> you</c><00:11:56.570><c> don't</c>

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:56.810 align:start position:0%
you don't I mean you do but you don't
 

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.950 align:start position:0%
you don't I mean you do but you don't
have<00:11:58.120><c> you're</c><00:11:59.120><c> not</c><00:11:59.240><c> just</c><00:11:59.420><c> kind</c><00:11:59.510><c> of</c><00:11:59.600><c> building</c>

00:11:59.950 --> 00:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
have you're not just kind of building
 

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.930 align:start position:0%
have you're not just kind of building
something<00:12:00.200><c> and</c><00:12:00.380><c> selling</c><00:12:00.770><c> it</c><00:12:00.920><c> you</c><00:12:01.400><c> have</c><00:12:01.730><c> to</c>

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:01.940 align:start position:0%
something and selling it you have to
 

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.580 align:start position:0%
something and selling it you have to
then<00:12:02.180><c> make</c><00:12:02.450><c> sure</c><00:12:02.660><c> you</c><00:12:02.780><c> have</c><00:12:02.960><c> the</c><00:12:03.170><c> things</c><00:12:03.410><c> to</c>

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:03.590 align:start position:0%
then make sure you have the things to
 

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.610 align:start position:0%
then make sure you have the things to
sell<00:12:03.850><c> on</c><00:12:04.850><c> the</c><00:12:04.910><c> other</c><00:12:05.150><c> side</c><00:12:05.450><c> so</c><00:12:05.930><c> it</c><00:12:06.230><c> is</c><00:12:06.350><c> really</c>

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:06.620 align:start position:0%
sell on the other side so it is really
 

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
sell on the other side so it is really
challenging<00:12:06.800><c> I</c><00:12:07.220><c> think</c><00:12:07.250><c> when</c><00:12:07.610><c> we</c><00:12:07.730><c> first</c>

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:07.970 align:start position:0%
challenging I think when we first
 

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:12.340 align:start position:0%
challenging I think when we first
started<00:12:08.420><c> we</c><00:12:08.800><c> we</c><00:12:09.800><c> were</c><00:12:10.160><c> very</c><00:12:10.720><c> MVP</c><00:12:11.720><c> like</c><00:12:11.990><c> in</c><00:12:12.230><c> our</c>

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.350 align:start position:0%
started we we were very MVP like in our
 

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
started we we were very MVP like in our
approach<00:12:12.680><c> so</c><00:12:13.100><c> I</c><00:12:13.430><c> think</c><00:12:13.550><c> in</c><00:12:13.820><c> the</c><00:12:13.880><c> first</c><00:12:14.030><c> version</c>

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:14.330 align:start position:0%
approach so I think in the first version
 

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.640 align:start position:0%
approach so I think in the first version
of<00:12:14.570><c> Sciences</c><00:12:14.990><c> change</c><00:12:15.200><c> which</c><00:12:15.380><c> as</c><00:12:15.560><c> you</c>

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:15.650 align:start position:0%
of Sciences change which as you
 

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:17.260 align:start position:0%
of Sciences change which as you
mentioned<00:12:16.010><c> was</c><00:12:16.190><c> actually</c><00:12:16.670><c> called</c><00:12:16.880><c> the</c><00:12:16.940><c> bench</c>

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:17.270 align:start position:0%

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:42.650 align:start position:0%
wouldn't use this make it seem like you
 

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.710 align:start position:0%
wouldn't use this make it seem like you
know<00:12:42.800><c> very</c><00:12:43.220><c> quick</c><00:12:43.550><c> to</c><00:12:43.790><c> get</c><00:12:43.940><c> something</c><00:12:44.390><c> up</c><00:12:44.540><c> and</c>

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
know very quick to get something up and
 

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
know very quick to get something up and

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:46.850 align:start position:0%
see who would test it out but it was
 

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.460 align:start position:0%
see who would test it out but it was
obvious<00:12:47.240><c> right</c><00:12:47.510><c> from</c><00:12:47.690><c> the</c><00:12:47.930><c> start</c><00:12:48.170><c> they</c><00:12:48.320><c> would</c>

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
obvious right from the start they would
 

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.710 align:start position:0%
obvious right from the start they would
actually<00:12:48.830><c> have</c><00:12:48.920><c> to</c><00:12:49.040><c> create</c><00:12:49.220><c> you</c><00:12:50.120><c> know</c><00:12:50.150><c> a</c><00:12:50.270><c> true</c>

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
actually have to create you know a true
 

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.410 align:start position:0%
actually have to create you know a true
marketplace<00:12:51.410><c> and</c><00:12:51.650><c> have</c><00:12:51.830><c> supply</c><00:12:52.400><c> that</c><00:12:53.150><c> was</c>

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:53.420 align:start position:0%
marketplace and have supply that was
 

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
marketplace and have supply that was

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.010 align:start position:0%

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%

so<00:12:58.220><c> with</c><00:12:58.340><c> Sciences</c><00:12:58.790><c> change</c><00:12:59.000><c> what</c><00:12:59.480><c> we</c><00:12:59.570><c> had</c><00:12:59.720><c> to</c>

00:12:59.800 --> 00:12:59.810 align:start position:0%
so with Sciences change what we had to
 

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.260 align:start position:0%
so with Sciences change what we had to
do<00:12:59.930><c> is</c><00:13:00.050><c> create</c><00:13:00.350><c> a</c><00:13:00.380><c> curated</c><00:13:01.130><c> marketplace</c><00:13:01.790><c> that</c>

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:02.270 align:start position:0%
do is create a curated marketplace that
 

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
do is create a curated marketplace that
operates<00:13:02.960><c> in</c><00:13:03.080><c> the</c><00:13:03.200><c> b2b</c><00:13:03.650><c> sector</c><00:13:03.950><c> so</c><00:13:04.400><c> what</c><00:13:04.880><c> we</c>

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:04.970 align:start position:0%
operates in the b2b sector so what we
 

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.970 align:start position:0%
operates in the b2b sector so what we
had<00:13:05.120><c> to</c><00:13:05.210><c> do</c><00:13:05.330><c> is</c><00:13:05.420><c> build</c><00:13:05.690><c> QA</c><00:13:06.260><c> so</c><00:13:06.380><c> Quality</c>

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:06.980 align:start position:0%
had to do is build QA so Quality
 

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:07.830 align:start position:0%
had to do is build QA so Quality
Assurance<00:13:07.070><c> we</c><00:13:07.580><c> had</c>

that's you know that's a huge value
proposition<00:14:54.340><c> it</c><00:14:54.910><c> took</c><00:14:55.150><c> us</c><00:14:55.300><c> a</c><00:14:55.330><c> lot</c><00:14:55.600><c> longer</c><00:14:55.660><c> to</c>

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
proposition it took us a lot longer to
 

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
proposition it took us a lot longer to
convince<00:14:56.980><c> the</c><00:14:57.340><c> large</c><00:14:57.760><c> players</c><00:14:58.150><c> in</c><00:14:58.390><c> the</c><00:14:58.480><c> market</c>

00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:58.870 align:start position:0%
convince the large players in the market
 

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
convince the large players in the market
so<00:14:59.140><c> the</c><00:14:59.410><c> large</c><00:14:59.620><c> CRO</c><00:15:00.160><c> is</c><00:15:00.220><c> that</c><00:15:00.580><c> this</c><00:15:00.910><c> would</c><00:15:01.090><c> be</c>

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:01.270 align:start position:0%
so the large CRO is that this would be
 

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
so the large CRO is that this would be
something<00:15:01.660><c> that</c><00:15:01.810><c> they</c><00:15:02.110><c> should</c><00:15:02.380><c> be</c><00:15:02.890><c> part</c><00:15:03.100><c> of</c>

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:03.310 align:start position:0%
something that they should be part of
 

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.010 align:start position:0%
something that they should be part of
but<00:15:03.580><c> actually</c><00:15:03.730><c> we</c><00:15:04.210><c> have</c><00:15:04.240><c> been</c><00:15:04.480><c> able</c><00:15:04.720><c> to</c><00:15:04.870><c> do</c>

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:05.020 align:start position:0%
but actually we have been able to do
 

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
but actually we have been able to do
that<00:15:05.170><c> as</c><00:15:05.290><c> well</c><00:15:05.440><c> so</c><00:15:05.800><c> I</c><00:15:06.040><c> think</c><00:15:06.520><c> one</c><00:15:06.790><c> of</c><00:15:06.820><c> the</c>

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:07.030 align:start position:0%
that as well so I think one of the
 

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
that as well so I think one of the

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:10.660 align:start position:0%

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.210 align:start position:0%

was that like when did you know you had
 

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
was that like when did you know you had

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:02.530 align:start position:0%
that and how did you define it in what
 

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
that and how did you define it in what

are the top two complex factors so I

that was important for us because when
 

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
that was important for us because when

you look at spend break down the market
 

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.220 align:start position:0%
you look at spend break down the market
is<00:25:39.440><c> you</c><00:25:40.190><c> know</c><00:25:40.309><c> predominantly</c><00:25:41.090><c> for</c><00:25:41.750><c> outsourced</c>

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
research focused in the pharmaceutical
industry<00:25:44.270><c> so</c><00:25:44.900><c> so</c><00:25:45.650><c> that</c><00:25:45.980><c> they</c><00:25:46.940><c> control</c><00:25:47.390><c> over</c><00:25:48.350><c> a</c>

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:48.410 align:start position:0%
industry so so that they control over a
 

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.440 align:start position:0%
industry so so that they control over a
hundred<00:25:48.740><c> billion</c><00:25:49.040><c> dollars</c><00:25:49.400><c> of</c><00:25:49.580><c> spins</c><00:25:49.940><c> per</c>

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:50.450 align:start position:0%

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:52.510 align:start position:0%
hundred billion dollars of spins per
year<00:25:50.780><c> and</c><00:25:51.050><c> so</c><00:25:51.290><c> if</c><00:25:51.380><c> we</c><00:25:51.530><c> can</c><00:25:51.740><c> if</c><00:25:52.010><c> we</c><00:25:52.040><c> couldn't</c><00:25:52.429><c> get</c>

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
year and so if we can if we couldn't get
 

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.940 align:start position:0%
year and so if we can if we couldn't get
them<00:25:52.700><c> to</c><00:25:52.880><c> use</c><00:25:53.030><c> the</c><00:25:53.179><c> platform</c><00:25:53.360><c> we</c><00:25:54.260><c> would</c><00:25:54.440><c> have</c><00:25:54.920><c> a</c>

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:54.950 align:start position:0%
them to use the platform we would have a
 

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:56.380 align:start position:0%
them to use the platform we would have a
lot<00:25:55.160><c> of</c><00:25:55.190><c> issue</c><00:25:55.400><c> with</c><00:25:55.700><c> really</c><00:25:55.970><c> creating</c><00:25:56.330><c> a</c>

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
truly large company today I think our
 

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
truly large company today I think our
biggest<00:26:00.650><c> issues</c><00:26:01.130><c> are</c><00:26:01.400><c> more</c><00:26:01.610><c> around</c><00:26:02.150><c> scaling</c>

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:02.809 align:start position:0%
biggest issues are more around scaling
 

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:05.620 align:start position:0%
biggest issues are more around scaling
so<00:26:03.140><c> how</c><00:26:03.410><c> do</c><00:26:03.470><c> we</c><00:26:03.910><c> we're</c><00:26:04.910><c> still</c><00:26:05.150><c> only</c><00:26:05.330><c> eighty</c>

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:05.630 align:start position:0%
so how do we we're still only eighty
 

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.470 align:start position:0%
so how do we we're still only eighty
five<00:26:05.900><c> people</c><00:26:06.380><c> we've</c><00:26:06.740><c> we've</c><00:26:07.400><c> just</c><00:26:07.610><c> signed</c><00:26:07.760><c> a</c>

couple of extremely large partners
 

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.589 align:start position:0%
couple of extremely large partners
and<00:26:10.899><c> so</c><00:26:11.079><c> we</c><00:26:11.259><c> are</c><00:26:11.379><c> really</c><00:26:11.639><c> trying</c><00:26:12.639><c> to</c><00:26:12.909><c> execute</c>

00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:20.109 align:start position:0%
staff that are focused on you know just
 

00:26:20.109 --> 00:26:22.529 align:start position:0%
staff that are focused on you know just
one<00:26:20.529><c> of</c><00:26:20.679><c> these</c><00:26:20.829><c> large</c><00:26:21.179><c> integrations</c><00:26:22.179><c> and</c><00:26:22.419><c> so</c>

00:26:22.529 --> 00:26:22.539 align:start position:0%
one of these large integrations and so
 

00:26:22.539 --> 00:26:24.599 align:start position:0%
one of these large integrations and so
trying<00:26:22.809><c> to</c><00:26:22.929><c> kind</c><00:26:23.229><c> of</c><00:26:23.289><c> make</c><00:26:23.859><c> sure</c><00:26:24.070><c> that</c><00:26:24.309><c> we</c>

00:26:24.599 --> 00:26:24.609 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of make sure that we
 

00:26:24.609 --> 00:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of make sure that we
don't<00:26:25.149><c> take</c><00:26:25.329><c> on</c><00:26:25.539><c> too</c><00:26:25.719><c> much</c><00:26:25.989><c> while</c><00:26:26.349><c> also</c>

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:27.190 align:start position:0%
don't take on too much while also
 

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.409 align:start position:0%
don't take on too much while also
realizing<00:26:27.789><c> there's</c><00:26:27.969><c> enormous</c><00:26:28.209><c> opportunity</c>

00:26:28.409 --> 00:26:28.419 align:start position:0%
realizing there's enormous opportunity
 

00:26:28.419 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
realizing there's enormous opportunity
so<00:26:29.139><c> we</c><00:26:29.229><c> don't</c><00:26:29.409><c> want</c><00:26:29.589><c> to</c><00:26:29.799><c> sort</c><00:26:30.039><c> of</c><00:26:30.159><c> overlook</c>

00:26:30.539 --> 00:26:30.549 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to sort of overlook
 

00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:32.659 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to sort of overlook
that<00:26:30.759><c> so</c><00:26:31.119><c> I</c><00:26:31.149><c> think</c><00:26:31.269><c> just</c><00:26:31.659><c> staying</c><00:26:31.899><c> focused</c>

00:26:32.659 --> 00:26:32.669 align:start position:0%
that so I think just staying focused
 

00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:35.519 align:start position:0%
that so I think just staying focused
executing<00:26:33.669><c> on</c><00:26:33.759><c> the</c><00:26:33.789><c> right</c><00:26:34.089><c> things</c><00:26:34.509><c> and</c><00:26:34.899><c> being</c>

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:28.430 align:start position:0%
reproducibility initiative was a
 

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
reproducibility initiative was a
game-changer<00:42:28.700><c> and</c><00:42:29.210><c> it</c><00:42:29.270><c> was</c><00:42:29.390><c> non</c><00:42:29.600><c> obvious</c><00:42:29.890><c> so</c>

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:30.890 align:start position:0%
game-changer and it was non obvious so
 

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:33.099 align:start position:0%
game-changer and it was non obvious so
in<00:42:31.430><c> some</c><00:42:32.359><c> ways</c><00:42:32.510><c> the</c><00:42:32.810><c> reproducibility</c>

00:42:33.099 --> 00:42:33.109 align:start position:0%
in some ways the reproducibility
 

00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:36.220 align:start position:0%
in some ways the reproducibility
initiative<00:42:33.980><c> goes</c><00:42:34.580><c> against</c><00:42:35.030><c> focus</c><00:42:35.480><c> it</c><00:42:36.050><c> was</c>

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:36.230 align:start position:0%
initiative goes against focus it was
 

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.530 align:start position:0%

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:36.230 align:start position:0%
think if you just think about what the

think if you just think about what the

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:06.380 align:start position:0%
because you just don't have the time to
 

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.829 align:start position:0%
because you just don't have the time to
put<00:47:06.560><c> into</c><00:47:06.710><c> it</c><00:47:06.829><c> so</c><00:47:06.980><c> we</c><00:47:07.849><c> are</c><00:47:07.970><c> possible</c><00:47:08.450><c> I</c><00:47:08.569><c> think</c>

00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
put into it so we are possible I think
 

00:47:08.839 --> 00:47:10.900 align:start position:0%
put into it so we are possible I think
it's<00:47:09.050><c> it's</c><00:47:09.410><c> really</c><00:47:09.589><c> great</c><00:47:10.280><c> if</c><00:47:10.400><c> you</c><00:47:10.430><c> can</c><00:47:10.700><c> kind</c>

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:10.910 align:start position:0%
it's it's really great if you can kind
 

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:12.849 align:start position:0%
it's it's really great if you can kind

00:47:12.849 --> 00:47:12.859 align:start position:0%

something for three months and really
 

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:16.540 align:start position:0%
something for three months and really
launch<00:47:15.890><c> the</c><00:47:16.130><c> company</c>

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:16.550 align:start position:0%
launch the company
 

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.420 align:start position:0%

so<00:47:17.180><c> for</c><00:47:17.359><c> us</c><00:47:17.390><c> we</c><00:47:17.869><c> literally</c><00:47:18.290><c> had</c><00:47:18.530><c> the</c><00:47:18.710><c> idea</c><00:47:19.069><c> and</c>

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:19.430 align:start position:0%
so for us we literally had the idea and
 

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:22.690 align:start position:0%
so for us we literally had the idea and
then<00:47:20.240><c> it</c><00:47:20.839><c> was</c><00:47:21.050><c> the</c><00:47:21.440><c> I</c><00:47:21.920><c> think</c><00:47:22.280><c> it</c><00:47:22.400><c> was</c><00:47:22.430><c> February</c>

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:22.700 align:start position:0%
then it was the I think it was February
 

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.950 align:start position:0%
then it was the I think it was February
2011<00:47:23.599><c> and</c><00:47:24.640><c> and</c><00:47:25.640><c> we</c><00:47:25.730><c> kind</c><00:47:25.910><c> of</c><00:47:26.000><c> we're</c><00:47:26.599><c> talking</c>

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
2011 and and we kind of we're talking
 

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.750 align:start position:0%
2011 and and we kind of we're talking
about<00:47:27.170><c> different</c><00:47:27.650><c> ideas</c><00:47:27.920><c> and</c><00:47:28.130><c> then</c><00:47:28.220><c> we</c><00:47:28.310><c> we</c>

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
about different ideas and then we we
 

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.849 align:start position:0%
about different ideas and then we we
thought<00:47:29.270><c> this</c><00:47:29.540><c> is</c><00:47:29.690><c> really</c><00:47:29.930><c> a</c><00:47:30.109><c> good</c><00:47:30.290><c> idea</c><00:47:30.349><c> and</c>

00:47:30.849 --> 00:47:30.859 align:start position:0%
thought this is really a good idea and
 

00:47:30.859 --> 00:47:34.300 align:start position:0%
thought this is really a good idea and
so<00:47:31.819><c> then</c><00:47:32.000><c> we</c><00:47:32.210><c> applied</c><00:47:33.140><c> to</c><00:47:33.170><c> Y</c><00:47:33.470><c> Combinator</c><00:47:33.500><c> so</c><00:47:34.190><c> we</c>

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:34.310 align:start position:0%
so then we applied to Y Combinator so we
 

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
so then we applied to Y Combinator so we
made<00:47:34.490><c> this</c><00:47:34.640><c> video</c><00:47:34.819><c> and</c><00:47:35.390><c> it</c><00:47:35.750><c> was</c><00:47:35.839><c> just</c><00:47:36.020><c> me</c><00:47:36.170><c> and</c>

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:44.030 align:start position:0%
Skyped me and he said you're not gonna
 

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
Skyped me and he said you're not gonna
get<00:47:44.270><c> in</c><00:47:44.450><c> and</c><00:47:44.869><c> I</c><00:47:45.079><c> was</c><00:47:45.200><c> like</c><00:47:45.410><c> oh</c><00:47:45.589><c> no</c><00:47:45.710><c> why</c><00:47:46.250><c> it</c><00:47:46.310><c> was</c>

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:46.730 align:start position:0%
get in and I was like oh no why it was
 

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.250 align:start position:0%
get in and I was like oh no why it was
slow<00:47:46.970><c> because</c><00:47:47.210><c> you</c><00:47:47.390><c> don't</c><00:47:47.690><c> have</c><00:47:47.839><c> a</c><00:47:47.869><c> technical</c>

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:48.260 align:start position:0%
slow because you don't have a technical
 

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.630 align:start position:0%
slow because you don't have a technical
co-founder<00:47:48.470><c> and</c><00:47:49.040><c> you</c><00:47:49.190><c> really</c><00:47:49.460><c> need</c><00:47:49.609><c> a</c>

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
co-founder and you really need a
 

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
co-founder and you really need a
technical<00:47:50.119><c> co-founder</c><00:47:50.210><c> and</c><00:47:50.839><c> so</c><00:47:51.260><c> we</c><00:47:52.160><c> then</c>

00:47:52.599 --> 00:47:52.609 align:start position:0%
technical co-founder and so we then
 

00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
technical co-founder and so we then
spoke<00:47:53.210><c> to</c><00:47:53.359><c> all</c><00:47:53.480><c> of</c><00:47:53.599><c> our</c><00:47:53.720><c> friends</c><00:47:54.170><c> and</c><00:47:54.260><c> we</c><00:47:54.380><c> found</c>

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:54.650 align:start position:0%
spoke to all of our friends and we found
 

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:57.370 align:start position:0%
spoke to all of our friends and we found
a<00:47:55.069><c> technical</c><00:47:55.819><c> co-founder</c><00:47:55.990><c> and</c><00:47:56.990><c> this</c><00:47:57.109><c> was</c><00:47:57.260><c> all</c>

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:57.380 align:start position:0%
a technical co-founder and this was all
 

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.079 align:start position:0%
a technical co-founder and this was all
just<00:47:57.500><c> in</c><00:47:57.650><c> like</c><00:47:57.800><c> two</c><00:47:58.010><c> weeks</c><00:47:58.250><c> and</c><00:47:58.550><c> then</c><00:47:58.670><c> we</c><00:47:58.760><c> built</c>

00:47:59.079 --> 00:47:59.089 align:start position:0%
just in like two weeks and then we built
 

00:47:59.089 --> 00:48:01.750 align:start position:0%
just in like two weeks and then we built
actually<00:47:59.660><c> a</c><00:47:59.960><c> really</c><00:48:00.589><c> hack</c><00:48:01.190><c> to</c><00:48:01.460><c> give</c><00:48:01.609><c> the</c>

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually a really hack to give the
 

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
actually a really hack to give the

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.180 align:start position:0%
interview and we had already got
something<00:48:07.339><c> kind</c><00:48:07.670><c> of</c><00:48:07.790><c> was</c><00:48:08.510><c> very</c><00:48:08.930><c> basic</c><00:48:09.109><c> but</c><00:48:09.650><c> we</c>

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:10.190 align:start position:0%
something kind of was very basic but we

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
to use the product so we actually did
 

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.590 align:start position:0%
to use the product so we actually did

transactions during that time just to
 

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.810 align:start position:0%
transactions during that time just to

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
prove that we understood the demand and
 

00:48:38.820 --> 00:49:23.330 align:start position:0%
prove that we understood the demand and
the<00:48:38.910><c> supply</c><00:48:38.940><c> side</c><00:48:39.920><c> you</c><00:48:40.920><c> know</c><00:49:22.040><c> yeah</c><00:49:23.040><c> so</c><00:49:23.250><c> the</c>

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
the supply side you know yeah so the
 

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.070 align:start position:0%
the supply side you know yeah so the
question<00:49:23.430><c> is</c><00:49:23.700><c> about</c><00:49:23.820><c> the</c><00:49:24.480><c> importance</c><00:49:24.930><c> of</c>

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
question is about the importance of
 

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:28.130 align:start position:0%
question is about the importance of

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
credentials in the biotech space and I
 

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.350 align:start position:0%
credentials in the biotech space and I
think<00:49:28.380><c> credentials</c><00:49:28.920><c> are</c><00:49:29.070><c> very</c><00:49:29.370><c> important</c><00:49:29.970><c> so</c>

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
think credentials are very important so
 

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.740 align:start position:0%
think credentials are very important so
if<00:49:31.080><c> you</c><00:49:31.530><c> can</c><00:49:31.980><c> have</c><00:49:32.400><c> you</c><00:49:32.940><c> know</c><00:49:32.970><c> credentials</c><00:49:33.660><c> in</c>

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:33.750 align:start position:0%
if you can have you know credentials in
 

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.390 align:start position:0%
if you can have you know credentials in
the<00:49:33.780><c> space</c><00:49:34.080><c> it's</c><00:49:34.350><c> just</c><00:49:34.620><c> you</c><00:49:35.040><c> know</c><00:49:35.130><c> it's</c><00:49:35.280><c> going</c>

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
the space it's just you know it's going
 

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.010 align:start position:0%
the space it's just you know it's going
to<00:49:35.460><c> give</c><00:49:35.640><c> you</c><00:49:35.790><c> obviously</c><00:49:36.420><c> a</c><00:49:36.450><c> huge</c><00:49:36.690><c> advantage</c>

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
to give you obviously a huge advantage
 

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.940 align:start position:0%
to give you obviously a huge advantage
but<00:49:37.950><c> in</c><00:49:38.370><c> saying</c><00:49:38.820><c> that</c><00:49:39.030><c> I</c><00:49:39.060><c> don't</c><00:49:39.240><c> think</c><00:49:39.480><c> it's</c><00:49:39.950><c> we</c>

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.340 align:start position:0%
two sided marketplace so for us quality

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:22.350 align:start position:0%
control is incredibly important and
 

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
control is incredibly important and
