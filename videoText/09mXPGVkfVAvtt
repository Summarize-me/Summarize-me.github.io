00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
if you're actually looking for the how I
 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.709 align:start position:0%
if you're actually looking for the how I
get<00:02:04.020><c> to</c><00:02:04.259><c> where</c><00:02:04.560><c> they</c><00:02:04.979><c> got</c>

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
get to where they got
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.290 align:start position:0%
get to where they got
there<00:02:07.200><c> might</c><00:02:07.380><c> be</c><00:02:07.500><c> some</c><00:02:07.680><c> yeah</c><00:02:07.979><c> some</c><00:02:08.280><c> tricks</c><00:02:08.640><c> and</c>

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 align:start position:0%
there might be some yeah some tricks and
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.150 align:start position:0%
there might be some yeah some tricks and
so<00:02:09.539><c> I</c><00:02:09.840><c> guess</c><00:02:09.959><c> to</c><00:02:10.140><c> start</c><00:02:10.319><c> with</c><00:02:10.500><c> the</c><00:02:10.860><c> example</c>

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
so I guess to start with the example
 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.890 align:start position:0%
so I guess to start with the example
that<00:02:11.340><c> folks</c><00:02:11.640><c> have</c><00:02:11.700><c> been</c><00:02:11.879><c> asking</c><00:02:12.180><c> us</c><00:02:12.300><c> about</c><00:02:12.660><c> a</c>

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
that folks have been asking us about a
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.650 align:start position:0%

lot<00:02:13.020><c> is</c><00:02:13.560><c> is</c><00:02:13.980><c> with</c><00:02:14.340><c> Sam</c><00:02:14.580><c> yes</c><00:02:15.000><c> and</c><00:02:15.180><c> so</c><00:02:15.300><c> again</c><00:02:15.420><c> we</c>

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
lot is is with Sam yes and so again we

where I'm like oh well I definitely went
 

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.670 align:start position:0%
where I'm like oh well I definitely went
through<00:11:57.180><c> that</c><00:11:57.420><c> and</c><00:11:57.720><c> I</c><00:11:57.899><c> want</c><00:11:58.019><c> to</c><00:11:58.200><c> help</c><00:11:58.380><c> people</c>

through that and I want to help people
 

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.430 align:start position:0%
through that and I want to help people
avoid<00:11:59.339><c> what</c><00:11:59.820><c> we</c><00:11:59.940><c> did</c><00:12:00.120><c> exactly</c>

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
avoid what we did exactly
 

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.210 align:start position:0%
avoid what we did exactly
and<00:12:02.220><c> so</c><00:12:02.640><c> I</c><00:12:03.120><c> think</c><00:12:03.240><c> it's</c><00:12:03.660><c> all</c><00:12:03.899><c> good</c><00:12:04.140><c> intent</c><00:12:04.440><c> but</c>

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's all good intent but
 

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.009 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's all good intent but
I<00:12:05.399><c> think</c><00:12:05.459><c> that</c><00:12:05.640><c> what's</c><00:12:05.820><c> tricky</c><00:12:06.240><c> is</c><00:12:06.420><c> that</c><00:12:06.660><c> if</c>

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:07.019 align:start position:0%
I think that what's tricky is that if
 

00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:10.069 align:start position:0%
I think that what's tricky is that if
you're<00:12:07.200><c> not</c><00:12:07.380><c> digging</c><00:12:07.740><c> for</c><00:12:07.980><c> the</c><00:12:08.160><c> facts</c>

you should totally do that yeah that
doesn't<00:16:39.000><c> apply</c><00:16:39.300><c> to</c><00:16:39.420><c> most</c><00:16:39.600><c> people</c><00:16:39.779><c> yes</c><00:16:40.500><c> and</c><00:16:40.860><c> so</c>

I think this is what's important I think
 

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.550 align:start position:0%
I think this is what's important I think
one<00:16:42.360><c> of</c><00:16:42.480><c> the</c><00:16:42.540><c> ways</c><00:16:42.720><c> that</c><00:16:42.839><c> we</c><00:16:43.019><c> try</c><00:16:43.139><c> to</c><00:16:43.259><c> kind</c><00:16:43.440><c> of</c>

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that we try to kind of
 

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.530 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that we try to kind of
control<00:16:43.680><c> ourselves</c><00:16:44.160><c> is</c>

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
control ourselves is
 

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.509 align:start position:0%
control ourselves is
figure<00:16:46.019><c> out</c><00:16:46.259><c> what</c><00:16:46.620><c> the</c><00:16:46.740><c> personal</c><00:16:46.980><c> advantages</c>
