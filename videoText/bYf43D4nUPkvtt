the experiments you ran there what you
 

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.780 align:start position:0%
the experiments you ran there what you

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:16.730 align:start position:0%

definitely so you know I'll just mention
one<00:30:16.940><c> one</c><00:30:17.540><c> example</c><00:30:17.690><c> is</c><00:30:18.790><c> we</c><00:30:19.790><c> saw</c><00:30:20.059><c> that</c><00:30:21.820><c> sometimes</c>

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:22.820 align:start position:0%
one one example is we saw that sometimes
 

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.180 align:start position:0%
one one example is we saw that sometimes
like<00:30:23.090><c> a</c><00:30:23.360><c> driver</c><00:30:23.750><c> a</c><00:30:23.900><c> new</c><00:30:24.230><c> driver</c><00:30:24.500><c> would</c><00:30:24.740><c> log</c><00:30:24.950><c> in</c>

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:25.190 align:start position:0%
like a driver a new driver would log in
