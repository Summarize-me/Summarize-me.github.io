00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:07.790 align:start position:0%
$500,000 and and then we'll just hit the
 

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
$500,000 and and then we'll just hit the

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:23.380 align:start position:0%
up so I heard that as soon as I heard
 

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.290 align:start position:0%
up so I heard that as soon as I heard
that<00:20:23.440><c> it</c><00:20:23.770><c> got</c><00:20:23.950><c> on</c><00:20:24.070><c> the</c><00:20:24.100><c> phone</c><00:20:24.370><c> we</c><00:20:24.790><c> just</c><00:20:25.000><c> figured</c>

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:25.300 align:start position:0%
that it got on the phone we just figured
 

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
that it got on the phone we just figured
it<00:20:25.450><c> out</c><00:20:25.480><c> we</c><00:20:25.870><c> just</c><00:20:26.110><c> try</c><00:20:26.290><c> to</c><00:20:26.350><c> figure</c><00:20:26.560><c> out</c><00:20:26.680><c> how</c><00:20:26.860><c> to</c>

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:26.890 align:start position:0%
it out we just try to figure out how to
 

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
it out we just try to figure out how to
so<00:20:27.460><c> we</c><00:20:28.000><c> had</c><00:20:28.150><c> to</c><00:20:28.330><c> find</c><00:20:28.720><c> 10</c><00:20:29.230><c> million</c><00:20:29.590><c> dollars</c>

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.010 align:start position:0%
so we had to find 10 million dollars
 

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.910 align:start position:0%
so we had to find 10 million dollars
because<00:20:30.280><c> the</c><00:20:30.550><c> line</c><00:20:30.730><c> was</c><00:20:30.910><c> going</c><00:20:31.120><c> from</c><00:20:31.440><c> 40</c><00:20:32.440><c> to</c><00:20:32.620><c> 30</c>

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
because the line was going from 40 to 30
 

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.450 align:start position:0%

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:51.430 align:start position:0%
I think you know once you get through it
 

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think you know once you get through it

was<00:20:57.940><c> a</c><00:20:57.970><c> very</c><00:20:58.570><c> interesting</c><00:20:58.930><c> time</c><00:20:59.350><c> there</c><00:20:59.740><c> was</c><00:20:59.830><c> a</c>

00:20:59.850 --> 00:20:59.860 align:start position:0%
was a very interesting time there was a
 

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
was a very interesting time there was a

I<00:21:03.670><c> think</c><00:21:04.180><c> 2005</c><00:21:05.020><c> and</c><00:21:05.260><c> 2006</c><00:21:05.950><c> were</c><00:21:06.250><c> starting</c><00:21:07.210><c> to</c>

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:07.330 align:start position:0%
I think 2005 and 2006 were starting to
 

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:10.210 align:start position:0%
get out of those downs for a lot of
 

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.530 align:start position:0%
get out of those downs for a lot of

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:15.370 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of downs I think this
