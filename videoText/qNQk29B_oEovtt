that affect your business in any way I
 

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.090 align:start position:0%
that affect your business in any way I
don't<00:30:29.480><c> think</c><00:30:29.660><c> so</c>

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:31.100 align:start position:0%
don't think so
 

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:32.860 align:start position:0%
don't think so
I<00:30:31.130><c> think</c><00:30:31.550><c> autonomous</c><00:30:31.880><c> cars</c><00:30:32.060><c> are</c><00:30:32.210><c> cool</c><00:30:32.360><c> like</c><00:30:32.390><c> it</c>

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:32.870 align:start position:0%
I think autonomous cars are cool like it
 

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.670 align:start position:0%
I think autonomous cars are cool like it
might<00:30:33.290><c> enable</c><00:30:33.800><c> people</c><00:30:33.980><c> to</c><00:30:34.160><c> live</c><00:30:34.340><c> farther</c><00:30:34.640><c> away</c>

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
might enable people to live farther away
 

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.830 align:start position:0%
might enable people to live farther away
but<00:30:36.680><c> I</c><00:30:36.800><c> don't</c><00:30:37.040><c> know</c><00:30:37.220><c> like</c><00:30:37.490><c> just</c><00:30:38.420><c> because</c><00:30:38.600><c> the</c>

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
but I don't know like just because the
 

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.110 align:start position:0%
but I don't know like just because the
commute<00:30:39.140><c> is</c><00:30:39.200><c> easier</c><00:30:39.560><c> it</c><00:30:40.340><c> still</c><00:30:40.670><c> takes</c><00:30:40.940><c> that</c>

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
commute is easier it still takes that
 

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:41.770 align:start position:0%
commute is easier it still takes that
much<00:30:41.300><c> time</c>

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:41.780 align:start position:0%
much time
 

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.140 align:start position:0%

so<00:30:42.500><c> I</c><00:30:42.830><c> mean</c><00:30:43.160><c> there</c><00:30:43.310><c> are</c><00:30:43.340><c> places</c><00:30:43.670><c> on</c><00:30:43.970><c> the</c><00:30:44.120><c> East</c>

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:44.150 align:start position:0%
so I mean there are places on the East
 

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:45.370 align:start position:0%
so I mean there are places on the East
