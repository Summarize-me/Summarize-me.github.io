investors<00:12:42.260><c> that</c><00:12:42.470><c> we</c><00:12:42.649><c> learned</c><00:12:43.060><c> what</c><00:12:44.060><c> metrics</c>

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
investors that we learned what metrics
 

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.470 align:start position:0%
investors that we learned what metrics
to<00:12:44.779><c> really</c><00:12:45.110><c> put</c><00:12:45.500><c> front</c><00:12:46.040><c> and</c><00:12:46.130><c> center</c><00:12:46.360><c> yeah</c><00:12:47.360><c> and</c>

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
to really put front and center yeah and
 

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.689 align:start position:0%
to really put front and center yeah and
I<00:12:47.510><c> think</c><00:12:47.570><c> related</c><00:12:47.959><c> to</c><00:12:48.079><c> that</c><00:12:48.290><c> those</c><00:12:48.980><c> KPIs</c><00:12:49.370><c> are</c>

00:12:49.689 --> 00:12:49.699 align:start position:0%
I think related to that those KPIs are
 

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:51.069 align:start position:0%
I think related to that those KPIs are
going<00:12:49.850><c> to</c><00:12:49.910><c> be</c><00:12:50.029><c> critical</c><00:12:50.480><c> for</c><00:12:50.510><c> your</c><00:12:50.750><c> business</c>

00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
going to be critical for your business
 

00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:53.410 align:start position:0%
going to be critical for your business
anyway<00:12:51.500><c> so</c><00:12:51.640><c> really</c><00:12:52.640><c> understanding</c><00:12:52.790><c> what</c>

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:53.420 align:start position:0%
anyway so really understanding what
 

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.030 align:start position:0%
anyway so really understanding what
those<00:12:53.570><c> KPIs</c><00:12:53.959><c> are</c><00:12:54.350><c> based</c><00:12:54.620><c> on</c><00:12:54.800><c> the</c><00:12:54.890><c> business</c>

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
those KPIs are based on the business
 

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.579 align:start position:0%
those KPIs are based on the business
type<00:12:55.430><c> and</c><00:12:55.790><c> then</c><00:12:55.970><c> tracking</c><00:12:56.240><c> those</c><00:12:56.589><c> rigorously</c>

00:12:57.579 --> 00:12:57.589 align:start position:0%
type and then tracking those rigorously
 

00:12:57.589 --> 00:12:59.050 align:start position:0%
type and then tracking those rigorously
as<00:12:57.800><c> you're</c><00:12:57.980><c> growing</c><00:12:58.100><c> the</c><00:12:58.339><c> company</c><00:12:58.730><c> and</c><00:12:58.940><c> then</c>

00:12:59.050 --> 00:12:59.060 align:start position:0%
as you're growing the company and then
 

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.329 align:start position:0%
as you're growing the company and then
those<00:12:59.269><c> will</c><00:12:59.600><c> give</c><00:13:00.170><c> you</c><00:13:00.380><c> sort</c><00:13:00.589><c> of</c><00:13:00.649><c> benchmarks</c>

00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:01.339 align:start position:0%
those will give you sort of benchmarks
 

00:13:01.339 --> 00:13:02.590 align:start position:0%
those will give you sort of benchmarks
for<00:13:01.550><c> where</c><00:13:01.699><c> you</c><00:13:01.820><c> need</c><00:13:01.970><c> to</c><00:13:02.060><c> be</c><00:13:02.240><c> when</c><00:13:02.480><c> you're</c>

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
for where you need to be when you're
 

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.269 align:start position:0%
for where you need to be when you're
going<00:13:02.750><c> to</c><00:13:02.930><c> each</c><00:13:03.050><c> rate</c><00:13:03.290><c> of</c><00:13:03.470><c> round</c><00:13:04.130><c> of</c>

going to each rate of round of
 

00:13:04.279 --> 00:13:05.170 align:start position:0%
going to each rate of round of
fundraising

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:05.180 align:start position:0%
fundraising
 

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
fundraising
so<00:13:05.750><c> how</c><00:13:05.960><c> has</c><00:13:06.170><c> it</c><00:13:06.200><c> changed</c><00:13:06.350><c> as</c><00:13:07.010><c> you</c><00:13:07.280><c> you</c><00:13:07.640><c> know</c>

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
so how has it changed as you you know
 

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
so how has it changed as you you know
you<00:13:07.820><c> went</c><00:13:08.120><c> to</c><00:13:08.150><c> reseed</c><00:13:08.570><c> you</c><00:13:09.350><c> know</c><00:13:09.470><c> an</c><00:13:09.680><c> a</c><00:13:09.950><c> a</c><00:13:10.250><c> B</c><00:13:10.520><c> and</c>

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:10.730 align:start position:0%
you went to reseed you know an a a B and
 

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.580 align:start position:0%
you went to reseed you know an a a B and
now<00:13:10.820><c> I</c><00:13:10.850><c> see</c><00:13:11.180><c> how</c><00:13:11.570><c> is</c><00:13:11.720><c> it</c><00:13:11.840><c> changed</c><00:13:12.260><c> throughout</c>

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:12.590 align:start position:0%
now I see how is it changed throughout
 

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
now I see how is it changed throughout
that<00:13:13.010><c> process</c><00:13:13.220><c> yeah</c><00:13:13.880><c> for</c><00:13:14.120><c> me</c><00:13:14.240><c> I</c><00:13:14.270><c> think</c>

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:14.570 align:start position:0%
that process yeah for me I think
 

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.450 align:start position:0%
that process yeah for me I think
actually<00:13:14.990><c> the</c><00:13:15.290><c> industry</c><00:13:15.710><c> has</c><00:13:15.800><c> also</c><00:13:15.980><c> changed</c><00:13:16.280><c> a</c>

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:16.460 align:start position:0%
actually the industry has also changed a
 

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.090 align:start position:0%
actually the industry has also changed a
lot<00:13:16.610><c> in</c><00:13:16.880><c> that</c><00:13:17.090><c> time</c><00:13:17.150><c> as</c><00:13:17.570><c> well</c><00:13:17.750><c> so</c><00:13:18.110><c> I</c><00:13:18.350><c> think</c><00:13:18.650><c> when</c>

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:19.100 align:start position:0%
lot in that time as well so I think when
 

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.940 align:start position:0%
lot in that time as well so I think when
we<00:13:19.280><c> started</c><00:13:19.610><c> science</c><00:13:19.970><c> exchange</c><00:13:20.380><c> 2011</c><00:13:21.380><c> it</c><00:13:21.830><c> was</c>

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:21.950 align:start position:0%
we started science exchange 2011 it was
 

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
we started science exchange 2011 it was
right<00:13:22.190><c> at</c><00:13:22.340><c> that</c><00:13:22.520><c> kind</c><00:13:23.000><c> of</c><00:13:23.090><c> bubble</c><00:13:23.600><c> when</c><00:13:23.780><c> people</c>

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:24.050 align:start position:0%
right at that kind of bubble when people
 

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.390 align:start position:0%
right at that kind of bubble when people
were<00:13:24.140><c> starting</c><00:13:24.440><c> to</c><00:13:24.800><c> think</c><00:13:25.010><c> about</c><00:13:25.100><c> becoming</c>

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
were starting to think about becoming
 

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.370 align:start position:0%
were starting to think about becoming
entrepreneurs<00:13:26.150><c> but</c><00:13:26.390><c> definitely</c><00:13:27.200><c> not</c>

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:27.380 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs but definitely not
 

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.740 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs but definitely not
available<00:13:28.220><c> of</c><00:13:28.460><c> interest</c><00:13:29.000><c> that</c><00:13:29.210><c> there</c><00:13:29.450><c> is</c><00:13:29.570><c> no</c>

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:29.750 align:start position:0%
available of interest that there is no
 

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.900 align:start position:0%
available of interest that there is no
that<00:13:30.170><c> we've</c><00:13:30.290><c> seen</c><00:13:30.680><c> the</c><00:13:31.070><c> huge</c><00:13:31.610><c> number</c><00:13:31.880><c> of</c>

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:31.910 align:start position:0%
that we've seen the huge number of
 

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.020 align:start position:0%
that we've seen the huge number of
people<00:13:32.060><c> in</c><00:13:32.240><c> the</c><00:13:32.300><c> audience</c><00:13:32.630><c> today</c><00:13:32.830><c> and</c><00:13:34.030><c> so</c>

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.030 align:start position:0%
people in the audience today and so
 

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
people in the audience today and so
that's<00:13:35.480><c> that's</c><00:13:35.960><c> amazing</c><00:13:36.530><c> to</c><00:13:36.650><c> see</c><00:13:36.800><c> so</c><00:13:37.010><c> many</c>

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.130 align:start position:0%
that's that's amazing to see so many
 

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.860 align:start position:0%
that's that's amazing to see so many
people<00:13:37.490><c> wanting</c><00:13:37.820><c> to</c><00:13:38.000><c> become</c><00:13:38.510><c> entrepreneurs</c>

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:38.870 align:start position:0%
people wanting to become entrepreneurs
 

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.350 align:start position:0%
people wanting to become entrepreneurs
but<00:13:39.470><c> it</c><00:13:39.560><c> also</c><00:13:39.710><c> creates</c><00:13:40.610><c> a</c><00:13:40.760><c> different</c><00:13:41.060><c> level</c><00:13:41.180><c> of</c>

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
but it also creates a different level of
 

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.910 align:start position:0%
but it also creates a different level of
expectation<00:13:42.080><c> around</c><00:13:42.170><c> where</c><00:13:42.500><c> you</c><00:13:42.620><c> should</c><00:13:42.800><c> be</c>

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
expectation around where you should be
 

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.530 align:start position:0%
expectation around where you should be
as<00:13:43.010><c> a</c><00:13:43.040><c> company</c><00:13:43.550><c> at</c><00:13:43.640><c> each</c><00:13:43.760><c> round</c><00:13:44.150><c> of</c><00:13:44.330><c> financing</c>

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:44.540 align:start position:0%
as a company at each round of financing
 

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
as a company at each round of financing
so<00:13:45.500><c> for</c><00:13:45.710><c> us</c><00:13:45.860><c> when</c><00:13:46.220><c> we</c><00:13:46.340><c> raised</c><00:13:46.580><c> our</c><00:13:46.760><c> Series</c><00:13:47.180><c> A</c><00:13:47.650><c> we</c>

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:48.650 align:start position:0%
so for us when we raised our Series A we
 

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.010 align:start position:0%
so for us when we raised our Series A we
al<00:13:49.430><c> series</c><00:13:49.700><c> day</c><00:13:49.850><c> was</c><00:13:50.030><c> like</c><00:13:50.300><c> three</c><00:13:50.750><c> or</c><00:13:50.780><c> four</c>

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:51.020 align:start position:0%
al series day was like three or four
 

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
al series day was like three or four
million<00:13:51.200><c> dollars</c><00:13:51.650><c> and</c><00:13:51.890><c> that</c><00:13:51.950><c> was</c><00:13:52.100><c> great</c><00:13:52.400><c> that</c>

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:52.610 align:start position:0%
million dollars and that was great that
 

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.610 align:start position:0%
million dollars and that was great that
was<00:13:52.760><c> like</c><00:13:52.940><c> totally</c><00:13:53.240><c> normal</c><00:13:53.810><c> back</c><00:13:53.990><c> then</c><00:13:54.260><c> and</c>

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:54.620 align:start position:0%
was like totally normal back then and
 

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.740 align:start position:0%
was like totally normal back then and
now<00:13:55.010><c> I</c><00:13:55.040><c> think</c><00:13:55.430><c> the</c><00:13:55.550><c> median</c><00:13:55.910><c> is</c><00:13:56.060><c> close</c><00:13:56.300><c> to</c><00:13:56.480><c> ten</c>

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:56.750 align:start position:0%
now I think the median is close to ten
 

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
now I think the median is close to ten
million<00:13:57.080><c> so</c><00:13:57.860><c> it's</c><00:13:58.010><c> a</c><00:13:58.100><c> very</c><00:13:58.280><c> different</c><00:13:58.610><c> type</c><00:13:59.180><c> of</c>

00:13:59.320 --> 00:13:59.330 align:start position:0%
million so it's a very different type of
 

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
million so it's a very different type of
expectation<00:13:59.630><c> around</c><00:14:00.140><c> where</c><00:14:00.860><c> you</c><00:14:01.010><c> should</c><00:14:01.190><c> be</c>

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.370 align:start position:0%
expectation around where you should be
 

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.070 align:start position:0%
expectation around where you should be
what<00:14:01.610><c> stage</c><00:14:01.820><c> of</c><00:14:01.970><c> company</c><00:14:02.390><c> should</c><00:14:02.660><c> be</c><00:14:02.810><c> when</c>

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
what stage of company should be when

but I certainly think that if you can
 

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.140 align:start position:0%
but I certainly think that if you can

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:47.150 align:start position:0%
push through and get that initial
 

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.060 align:start position:0%
push through and get that initial

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.070 align:start position:0%
