it's definitely something you can
experiment<00:01:37.600><c> with</c><00:01:38.000><c> i</c><00:01:38.079><c> think</c><00:01:38.320><c> with</c><00:01:38.479><c> this</c><00:01:39.040><c> it's</c>

uh<00:01:39.920><c> yeah</c><00:01:40.159><c> there's</c><00:01:40.400><c> a</c><00:01:40.479><c> little</c><00:01:40.799><c> lack</c><00:01:41.360><c> of</c>

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh yeah there's a little lack of
 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.149 align:start position:0%
uh yeah there's a little lack of
information<00:01:42.320><c> here</c><00:01:42.560><c> to</c><00:01:42.720><c> make</c><00:01:42.960><c> a</c><00:01:43.040><c> decision</c><00:01:44.000><c> and</c>

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
information here to make a decision and
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.749 align:start position:0%
information here to make a decision and
so<00:01:44.320><c> maybe</c><00:01:44.640><c> adding</c><00:01:44.880><c> some</c><00:01:45.119><c> information</c><00:01:45.600><c> about</c>

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 align:start position:0%

so maybe adding some information about
what<00:01:45.920><c> you</c><00:01:46.159><c> guys</c><00:01:46.399><c> do</c><00:01:46.960><c> or</c><00:01:47.119><c> kind</c><00:01:47.280><c> of</c><00:01:47.439><c> create</c><00:01:47.759><c> some</c>

it this is a really good headline it's
 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.469 align:start position:0%
it this is a really good headline it's
super<00:02:06.320><c> clear</c><00:02:07.040><c> what</c><00:02:07.200><c> they</c><00:02:07.439><c> actually</c><00:02:07.759><c> do</c>

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.070 align:start position:0%
and i guess now that i see some of the
drop<00:02:10.479><c> down</c><00:02:10.720><c> some</c><00:02:10.879><c> of</c><00:02:10.959><c> the</c><00:02:11.039><c> videos</c><00:02:11.440><c> make</c><00:02:11.680><c> sense</c>

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
drop down some of the videos make sense
 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.430 align:start position:0%

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 align:start position:0%

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
just like a couple people working out
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.110 align:start position:0%
just like a couple people working out
and<00:02:31.440><c> then</c><00:02:31.599><c> the</c><00:02:31.760><c> far</c><00:02:32.000><c> away</c><00:02:32.239><c> shot</c><00:02:32.480><c> of</c><00:02:32.640><c> the</c><00:02:32.720><c> ocean</c>

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.869 align:start position:0%
and then the far away shot of the ocean
visually<00:02:33.599><c> is</c><00:02:33.680><c> really</c><00:02:34.000><c> cool</c>

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 align:start position:0%
visually is really cool
 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.309 align:start position:0%
visually is really cool
but<00:02:35.280><c> it</c><00:02:35.360><c> didn't</c><00:02:35.519><c> occur</c><00:02:35.760><c> to</c><00:02:35.840><c> me</c><00:02:35.920><c> that</c><00:02:36.080><c> was</c>

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
but it didn't occur to me that was
 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.350 align:start position:0%
but it didn't occur to me that was
surfing

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
surfing
 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.070 align:start position:0%

and<00:02:37.599><c> so</c><00:02:38.239><c> um</c><00:02:38.640><c> i</c><00:02:38.800><c> wasn't</c><00:02:39.120><c> exactly</c><00:02:39.760><c> sure</c><00:02:39.920><c> what</c>

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
and so um i wasn't exactly sure what
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.750 align:start position:0%
and so um i wasn't exactly sure what
some<00:02:40.239><c> of</c><00:02:40.319><c> those</c><00:02:40.640><c> were</c>

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
some of those were
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.589 align:start position:0%
some of those were
um<00:02:42.000><c> but</c><00:02:42.160><c> now</c><00:02:42.319><c> that</c><00:02:42.400><c> you</c><00:02:42.560><c> do</c><00:02:42.720><c> the</c><00:02:42.800><c> drop</c><00:02:43.040><c> down</c><00:02:43.280><c> now</c>

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
um but now that you do the drop down now
 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.910 align:start position:0%
um but now that you do the drop down now
it<00:02:43.760><c> makes</c><00:02:44.000><c> a</c><00:02:44.080><c> lot</c><00:02:44.239><c> more</c><00:02:44.480><c> sense</c><00:02:44.720><c> to</c><00:02:44.879><c> me</c><00:02:45.440><c> it</c><00:02:45.680><c> seems</c>

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
it makes a lot more sense to me it seems
 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.670 align:start position:0%
it makes a lot more sense to me it seems
like<00:02:46.080><c> maybe</c><00:02:46.319><c> you're</c><00:02:46.560><c> trying</c><00:02:46.879><c> to</c><00:02:47.040><c> scroll</c><00:02:47.440><c> down</c>

them and the hovers are really strong
they<00:03:16.879><c> don't</c><00:03:17.200><c> immediately</c><00:03:17.680><c> look</c><00:03:17.840><c> like</c><00:03:18.080><c> they're</c>

uh<00:03:20.159><c> i</c><00:03:20.239><c> think</c><00:03:20.480><c> that</c><00:03:20.800><c> that</c><00:03:21.040><c> hover</c><00:03:21.680><c> makes</c><00:03:21.920><c> it</c><00:03:22.000><c> a</c>

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh i think that that hover makes it a
 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.509 align:start position:0%
uh i think that that hover makes it a
little<00:03:22.239><c> bit</c><00:03:22.319><c> more</c><00:03:22.560><c> obvious</c>

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
like i don't know maybe that's what they
 

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.949 align:start position:0%
like i don't know maybe that's what they

something<00:10:25.279><c> else</c><00:10:25.519><c> instead</c><00:10:26.079><c> so</c><00:10:26.320><c> like</c><00:10:26.480><c> that's</c>

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
something else instead so like that's
 

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.310 align:start position:0%
something else instead so like that's
just<00:10:26.959><c> kind</c><00:10:27.120><c> of</c><00:10:27.200><c> a</c><00:10:27.279><c> good</c><00:10:27.440><c> way</c><00:10:27.600><c> to</c><00:10:27.760><c> pressure</c><00:10:28.079><c> test</c>

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
with teammates again right so we're just
 

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.590 align:start position:0%
with teammates again right so we're just
kind<00:14:44.480><c> of</c><00:14:44.639><c> like</c><00:14:44.800><c> creating</c><00:14:45.120><c> a</c><00:14:45.199><c> lot</c><00:14:45.360><c> of</c><00:14:45.440><c> like</c>

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
kind of like creating a lot of like
 

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.350 align:start position:0%
kind of like creating a lot of like
redundant<00:14:46.079><c> info</c><00:14:46.560><c> and</c><00:14:46.639><c> then</c><00:14:46.800><c> you</c><00:14:46.880><c> also</c><00:14:47.120><c> have</c>

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
redundant info and then you also have
 

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.710 align:start position:0%
redundant info and then you also have
like<00:14:47.839><c> this</c><00:14:48.079><c> sort</c><00:14:48.240><c> of</c><00:14:48.560><c> visual</c><00:14:49.279><c> diagram</c><00:14:49.920><c> of</c>

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
like this sort of visual diagram of
 

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.710 align:start position:0%
like this sort of visual diagram of
sharing<00:14:51.040><c> with</c><00:14:51.199><c> colleagues</c><00:14:51.760><c> and</c><00:14:52.320><c> i</c><00:14:52.399><c> guess</c><00:14:52.560><c> like</c>

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
sharing with colleagues and i guess like
 

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
sharing with colleagues and i guess like
if<00:14:52.880><c> anyone</c><00:14:53.199><c> really</c><00:14:53.440><c> like</c><00:14:53.600><c> uses</c><00:14:53.920><c> google</c><00:14:54.240><c> docs</c>

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
if anyone really like uses google docs
 

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.230 align:start position:0%
if anyone really like uses google docs
it's<00:14:54.720><c> almost</c><00:14:55.040><c> like</c>

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's almost like
 

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.550 align:start position:0%
it's almost like
you<00:14:56.399><c> know</c><00:14:56.480><c> this</c><00:14:56.639><c> should</c><00:14:56.959><c> probably</c><00:14:57.360><c> be</c><00:14:57.600><c> very</c>

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know this should probably be very
 

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.949 align:start position:0%
you know this should probably be very
um<00:14:59.199><c> you</c><00:14:59.279><c> know</c><00:14:59.519><c> intuitive</c><00:14:59.920><c> to</c><00:15:00.079><c> someone</c><00:15:00.320><c> when</c>

00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
um you know intuitive to someone when
 

00:15:00.959 --> 00:15:02.310 align:start position:0%
um you know intuitive to someone when
you're<00:15:01.120><c> talking</c><00:15:01.440><c> about</c><00:15:01.680><c> sharing</c><00:15:01.920><c> this</c><00:15:02.079><c> stuff</c>

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
you're talking about sharing this stuff
 

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.230 align:start position:0%
you're talking about sharing this stuff
with<00:15:02.480><c> other</c><00:15:02.720><c> developers</c><00:15:03.680><c> so</c><00:15:03.839><c> i'm</c><00:15:03.920><c> not</c><00:15:04.079><c> sure</c>

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
with other developers so i'm not sure
 

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.910 align:start position:0%
with other developers so i'm not sure
you<00:15:04.320><c> even</c><00:15:04.560><c> really</c><00:15:04.720><c> need</c><00:15:04.880><c> this</c><00:15:05.040><c> type</c><00:15:05.279><c> of</c><00:15:05.360><c> visual</c>

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
you even really need this type of visual
 

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.949 align:start position:0%
you even really need this type of visual
treatment

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:15:07.120><c> that</c><00:15:07.279><c> diagram</c><00:15:07.760><c> hurts</c><00:15:08.079><c> my</c><00:15:08.240><c> head</c><00:15:08.639><c> trying</c>

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that diagram hurts my head trying
 

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.470 align:start position:0%
yeah that diagram hurts my head trying
to<00:15:08.880><c> figure</c><00:15:09.120><c> out</c><00:15:09.199><c> what's</c><00:15:09.440><c> happening</c><00:15:09.760><c> there</c>

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out what's happening there
 

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.310 align:start position:0%
to figure out what's happening there
and<00:15:12.560><c> then</c><00:15:12.720><c> we</c><00:15:12.800><c> have</c><00:15:12.959><c> another</c><00:15:13.279><c> feature</c><00:15:13.600><c> section</c>

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
and then we have another feature section
 

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.710 align:start position:0%
and then we have another feature section
with<00:15:14.639><c> six</c><00:15:14.880><c> more</c><00:15:15.120><c> features</c>

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
with six more features
 

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.870 align:start position:0%
with six more features
so<00:15:17.120><c> i</c><00:15:17.279><c> wonder</c><00:15:17.519><c> if</c><00:15:17.680><c> you</c><00:15:17.760><c> can</c><00:15:17.920><c> kind</c><00:15:18.079><c> of</c>

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
so i wonder if you can kind of
 

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
so i wonder if you can kind of
um<00:15:19.440><c> put</c><00:15:20.160><c> maybe</c><00:15:20.480><c> some</c><00:15:20.639><c> of</c><00:15:20.720><c> these</c><00:15:21.120><c> sections</c>

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
um put maybe some of these sections
 

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.430 align:start position:0%
um put maybe some of these sections
within<00:15:22.480><c> you</c><00:15:22.639><c> know</c><00:15:22.800><c> a</c><00:15:22.880><c> different</c><00:15:23.199><c> type</c><00:15:23.360><c> of</c>

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
within you know a different type of
