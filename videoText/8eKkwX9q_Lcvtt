00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:19.350 align:start position:0%
cake so how did being part of YC help
with<00:24:17.159><c> the</c><00:24:17.279><c> fund</c><00:24:17.600><c> raise</c><00:24:18.360><c> um</c><00:24:18.880><c> especially</c><00:24:19.240><c> if</c>

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
with the fund raise um especially if
 

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.789 align:start position:0%
with the fund raise um especially if
you've<00:24:19.640><c> had</c><00:24:19.760><c> the</c><00:24:19.880><c> experience</c><00:24:20.159><c> of</c><00:24:20.279><c> fundraising</c>

00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
you've had the experience of fundraising
 

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:23.950 align:start position:0%
you've had the experience of fundraising
without<00:24:21.360><c> YC</c><00:24:21.799><c> in</c><00:24:21.880><c> the</c>

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
without YC in the
 

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:27.029 align:start position:0%
without YC in the
past<00:24:24.960><c> um</c><00:24:25.919><c> especially</c><00:24:26.279><c> because</c><00:24:26.520><c> I</c><00:24:26.640><c> tried</c><00:24:26.880><c> to</c>

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
past um especially because I tried to
 

00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:29.909 align:start position:0%
past um especially because I tried to
raise<00:24:27.440><c> in</c><00:24:27.679><c> France</c><00:24:28.080><c> before</c><00:24:28.480><c> raising</c><00:24:29.159><c> in</c><00:24:29.440><c> in</c>

00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
raise in France before raising in in
 

00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:33.190 align:start position:0%
raise in France before raising in in
here<00:24:30.399><c> so</c><00:24:31.000><c> I</c><00:24:31.120><c> think</c><00:24:31.279><c> it</c><00:24:31.440><c> helped</c><00:24:31.760><c> for</c><00:24:32.080><c> like</c><00:24:32.919><c> four</c>

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
here so I think it helped for like four
 

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.590 align:start position:0%
here so I think it helped for like four
main<00:24:33.480><c> reasons</c><00:24:33.960><c> the</c><00:24:34.080><c> first</c><00:24:34.320><c> one</c><00:24:34.559><c> is</c><00:24:34.919><c> you</c><00:24:35.080><c> get</c><00:24:35.480><c> a</c>

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
main reasons the first one is you get a
 

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.549 align:start position:0%
main reasons the first one is you get a
lot<00:24:35.760><c> of</c><00:24:36.000><c> exposure</c><00:24:36.720><c> and</c><00:24:36.840><c> that's</c><00:24:37.000><c> priceless</c>

00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
lot of exposure and that's priceless
 

00:24:37.559 --> 00:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
lot of exposure and that's priceless
because<00:24:37.799><c> most</c><00:24:37.919><c> of</c><00:24:38.080><c> the</c><00:24:38.240><c> time</c><00:24:38.760><c> lots</c><00:24:39.000><c> of</c>

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
because most of the time lots of
 

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.110 align:start position:0%
because most of the time lots of
investors<00:24:39.880><c> will</c><00:24:40.080><c> reach</c><00:24:40.320><c> out</c><00:24:40.480><c> to</c><00:24:40.640><c> you</c><00:24:41.000><c> and</c>

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
investors will reach out to you and
 

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.149 align:start position:0%
investors will reach out to you and
that's<00:24:41.279><c> a</c><00:24:41.440><c> privilege</c><00:24:42.200><c> the</c><00:24:42.360><c> second</c><00:24:42.679><c> one</c><00:24:42.880><c> is</c><00:24:43.039><c> you</c>

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
that's a privilege the second one is you
 

00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:45.389 align:start position:0%
that's a privilege the second one is you
get<00:24:43.279><c> a</c><00:24:43.399><c> lot</c><00:24:43.520><c> of</c><00:24:43.679><c> credibility</c><00:24:44.240><c> and</c><00:24:44.440><c> that's</c><00:24:45.120><c> even</c>

00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
get a lot of credibility and that's even
 

00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:47.029 align:start position:0%
get a lot of credibility and that's even
more<00:24:45.640><c> true</c><00:24:45.919><c> if</c><00:24:46.039><c> you</c><00:24:46.159><c> don't</c><00:24:46.399><c> come</c><00:24:46.640><c> from</c><00:24:46.880><c> the</c>

more true if you don't come from the
valley<00:24:47.840><c> uh</c><00:24:48.000><c> I</c><00:24:48.080><c> think</c><00:24:48.240><c> I</c><00:24:48.320><c> would</c><00:24:48.559><c> have</c><00:24:48.679><c> a</c><00:24:48.880><c> really</c>

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.350 align:start position:0%
valley uh I think I would have a really
hard<00:24:49.520><c> time</c><00:24:49.760><c> to</c><00:24:49.919><c> raise</c><00:24:50.159><c> money</c><00:24:50.480><c> here</c><00:24:50.960><c> if</c><00:24:51.080><c> I</c><00:24:51.200><c> were</c>

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
hard time to raise money here if I were
 

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.830 align:start position:0%
hard time to raise money here if I were
not<00:24:51.559><c> part</c><00:24:51.760><c> of</c><00:24:51.919><c> YC</c><00:24:52.919><c> and</c><00:24:53.039><c> then</c><00:24:53.200><c> I</c><00:24:53.279><c> think</c><00:24:53.480><c> the</c><00:24:53.640><c> fact</c>

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
not part of YC and then I think the fact
 

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.070 align:start position:0%
not part of YC and then I think the fact
that<00:24:54.240><c> all</c><00:24:54.440><c> your</c><00:24:54.679><c> batchmates</c><00:24:55.320><c> are</c><00:24:55.520><c> raising</c><00:24:55.919><c> at</c>

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
that all your batchmates are raising at

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
think the fact that I will be the most
