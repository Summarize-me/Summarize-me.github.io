they thought that people would be asking
 

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.210 align:start position:0%
they thought that people would be asking

for all those really hard stuff and what
 

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.670 align:start position:0%
for all those really hard stuff and what
they<00:10:50.399><c> asked</c><00:10:50.700><c> for</c><00:10:50.820><c> was</c><00:10:51.600><c> embarrassing</c><00:10:52.380><c> because</c>

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
they asked for was embarrassing because
 

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.590 align:start position:0%
they asked for was embarrassing because
it<00:10:52.980><c> was</c><00:10:53.160><c> so</c><00:10:53.399><c> obvious</c><00:10:53.700><c> and</c><00:10:53.880><c> easy</c><00:10:54.120><c> to</c><00:10:54.300><c> implement</c>

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
it was so obvious and easy to implement
 

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.990 align:start position:0%
it was so obvious and easy to implement
so<00:10:55.140><c> it's</c><00:10:55.380><c> just</c><00:10:55.620><c> that</c><00:10:55.740><c> they</c><00:10:55.860><c> never</c><00:10:56.040><c> bothered</c><00:10:56.880><c> to</c>

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
so it's just that they never bothered to
 

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.610 align:start position:0%
so it's just that they never bothered to
ask<00:10:57.180><c> never</c><00:10:57.540><c> bought</c><00:10:57.779><c> the</c><00:10:57.959><c> desk</c><00:10:58.140><c> and</c><00:10:58.500><c> and</c>

00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
ask never bought the desk and and
 

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.949 align:start position:0%
ask never bought the desk and and
actually<00:10:58.920><c> it</c><00:10:59.220><c> was</c><00:10:59.399><c> even</c><00:10:59.579><c> more</c><00:10:59.940><c> it</c><00:11:00.720><c> was</c><00:11:00.839><c> even</c>

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
actually it was even more it was even
 

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:02.870 align:start position:0%
actually it was even more it was even

more Insidious than that for these users
 

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.130 align:start position:0%
more Insidious than that for these users
they<00:11:03.120><c> made</c><00:11:03.240><c> a</c><00:11:03.420><c> complicated</c><00:11:03.660><c> relationship</c>

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
they made a complicated relationship
 

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.590 align:start position:0%
