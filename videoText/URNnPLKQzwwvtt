had that opportunity to have that offer
 

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.689 align:start position:0%
had that opportunity to have that offer
was<00:12:32.310><c> because</c><00:12:32.670><c> I</c><00:12:32.790><c> had</c><00:12:33.000><c> worked</c><00:12:33.240><c> with</c><00:12:33.420><c> Kevin</c><00:12:34.019><c> for</c>

00:12:34.689 --> 00:12:34.699 align:start position:0%
was because I had worked with Kevin for
 

00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:39.410 align:start position:0%
was because I had worked with Kevin for

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:41.790 align:start position:0%
years and I had essentially slugged my
 

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.189 align:start position:0%

00:12:45.679 --> 00:12:45.689 align:start position:0%
for four long years and that was the
 

00:12:45.689 --> 00:12:49.100 align:start position:0%
for four long years and that was the

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.110 align:start position:0%
reason I got that seed offer so while
 

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.689 align:start position:0%
reason I got that seed offer so while

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
