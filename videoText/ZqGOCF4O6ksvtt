00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
imagine you sat down the blackjack table
 

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.769 align:start position:0%
imagine you sat down the blackjack table
but<00:14:04.680><c> you</c><00:14:04.860><c> didn't</c><00:14:05.040><c> know</c><00:14:05.459><c> basic</c><00:14:06.300><c> Blackjack</c>

00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
but you didn't know basic Blackjack
 

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:08.150 align:start position:0%
but you didn't know basic Blackjack
strategy<00:14:07.200><c> right</c><00:14:07.500><c> so</c><00:14:07.680><c> you</c><00:14:07.800><c> know</c><00:14:07.920><c> to</c><00:14:08.040><c> double</c>

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
strategy right so you know to double
 

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.829 align:start position:0%
strategy right so you know to double
down<00:14:08.279><c> when</c><00:14:08.519><c> to</c><00:14:08.639><c> split</c><00:14:08.880><c> yeah</c><00:14:09.060><c> so</c><00:14:09.420><c> when</c><00:14:09.600><c> you</c>

00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
down when to split yeah so when you
 

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:11.690 align:start position:0%
down when to split yeah so when you
could<00:14:10.019><c> still</c><00:14:10.139><c> you</c><00:14:10.560><c> can</c><00:14:10.680><c> still</c><00:14:10.860><c> win</c><00:14:11.160><c> you</c><00:14:11.639><c> can't</c>

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
could still you can still win you can't
 

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
could still you can still win you can't
but<00:14:12.000><c> like</c><00:14:12.720><c> it</c><00:14:13.320><c> is</c><00:14:13.500><c> so</c><00:14:13.740><c> easy</c><00:14:13.920><c> to</c><00:14:14.339><c> get</c><00:14:14.459><c> that</c><00:14:14.760><c> one</c>

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
but like it is so easy to get that one
 

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.090 align:start position:0%
but like it is so easy to get that one
hour<00:14:15.360><c> of</c><00:14:15.720><c> instruction</c><00:14:15.959><c> and</c><00:14:16.500><c> that</c><00:14:16.620><c> increases</c>

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
hour of instruction and that increases
 

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.250 align:start position:0%
hour of instruction and that increases
your<00:14:17.339><c> odds</c><00:14:17.700><c> so</c><00:14:17.940><c> much</c>

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
your odds so much
