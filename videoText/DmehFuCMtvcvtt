00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
something way more high-tech and they
 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.370 align:start position:0%
something way more high-tech and they
were<00:01:38.159><c> like</c><00:01:38.280><c> I</c><00:01:38.400><c> don't</c><00:01:38.520><c> know</c><00:01:38.640><c> VR</c><00:01:39.299><c> headsets</c><00:01:39.780><c> and</c>
