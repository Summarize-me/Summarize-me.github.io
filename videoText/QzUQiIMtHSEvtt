start from from zero we would meet them
anyone<00:09:48.089><c> who</c><00:09:48.149><c> saw</c><00:09:48.569><c> a</c><00:09:48.600><c> plan</c><00:09:48.929><c> Guren</c><00:09:49.170><c> and</c><00:09:49.319><c> was</c>

anyone who saw a plan Guren and was

understood<00:09:53.879><c> the</c><00:09:53.999><c> problem</c><00:09:54.269><c> that</c><00:09:54.360><c> we</c><00:09:54.480><c> were</c>

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:54.569 align:start position:0%
understood the problem that we were
 

00:09:54.569 --> 00:09:55.789 align:start position:0%
understood the problem that we were

00:09:55.789 --> 00:09:55.799 align:start position:0%
trying to solve and it's like yeah
 

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:57.410 align:start position:0%
trying to solve and it's like yeah
that's<00:09:56.040><c> nice</c><00:09:56.279><c> but</c><00:09:56.549><c> I</c><00:09:56.610><c> don't</c><00:09:56.879><c> have</c><00:09:56.970><c> you</c><00:09:57.389><c> know</c>

that's nice but I don't have you know

that's nice but I don't have you know
mobile<00:09:57.629><c> devices</c><00:09:58.079><c> and</c><00:09:58.230><c> so</c><00:09:58.379><c> really</c><00:09:59.100><c> trying</c><00:09:59.339><c> to</c>

00:09:59.449 --> 00:09:59.459 align:start position:0%
mobile devices and so really trying to
 

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:03.530 align:start position:0%
mobile devices and so really trying to
find<00:09:59.819><c> the</c><00:10:00.389><c> friction</c><00:10:00.899><c> point</c><00:10:01.230><c> of</c><00:10:02.149><c> why</c><00:10:03.149><c> are</c><00:10:03.360><c> they</c>

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
find the friction point of why are they
 

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.419 align:start position:0%
find the friction point of why are they
not<00:10:03.689><c> adopting</c><00:10:04.379><c> the</c><00:10:04.470><c> software</c><00:10:04.889><c> especially</c>

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:05.429 align:start position:0%
not adopting the software especially
 

00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:06.590 align:start position:0%
not adopting the software especially
when<00:10:05.610><c> you've</c><00:10:05.790><c> built</c><00:10:05.999><c> something</c><00:10:06.269><c> that</c><00:10:06.509><c> they</c>

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
when you've built something that they
 

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.929 align:start position:0%
when you've built something that they
actually<00:10:06.629><c> want</c><00:10:07.110><c> and</c><00:10:07.499><c> so</c><00:10:08.100><c> for</c><00:10:08.339><c> us</c><00:10:08.490><c> we</c><00:10:08.670><c> had</c><00:10:08.850><c> to</c>

00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:08.939 align:start position:0%
actually want and so for us we had to
 

00:10:08.939 --> 00:10:10.850 align:start position:0%
actually want and so for us we had to
remove<00:10:09.269><c> the</c><00:10:09.509><c> friction</c><00:10:09.869><c> the</c><00:10:09.929><c> barrier</c><00:10:10.410><c> of</c><00:10:10.649><c> them</c>

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
remove the friction the barrier of them
 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.009 align:start position:0%
remove the friction the barrier of them
not<00:10:11.069><c> having</c><00:10:11.429><c> the</c><00:10:11.639><c> hardware</c><00:10:12.089><c> to</c><00:10:12.509><c> support</c><00:10:12.689><c> the</c>

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:16.819 align:start position:0%
not having the hardware to support the

00:10:16.819 --> 00:10:16.829 align:start position:0%
software so we in 2012 we were giving
 

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:19.939 align:start position:0%
software so we in 2012 we were giving
out<00:10:16.949><c> iPads</c><00:10:17.399><c> away</c><00:10:17.699><c> for</c><00:10:17.970><c> free</c><00:10:18.649><c> well</c><00:10:19.649><c> we</c><00:10:19.829><c> were</c>

00:10:19.939 --> 00:10:19.949 align:start position:0%
out iPads away for free well we were
 

00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
out iPads away for free well we were
actually<00:10:20.069><c> no</c><00:10:20.339><c> that's</c><00:10:20.519><c> not</c><00:10:20.639><c> true</c><00:10:20.759><c> we</c><00:10:21.149><c> were</c>

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
actually no that's not true we were
 

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
actually no that's not true we were
loaning<00:10:22.920><c> it</c><00:10:23.009><c> out</c><00:10:23.189><c> to</c><00:10:23.399><c> them</c><00:10:23.549><c> okay</c><00:10:24.059><c> mhm</c><00:10:24.299><c> and</c><00:10:24.540><c> then</c>

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.170 align:start position:0%
loaning it out to them okay mhm and then
 

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.569 align:start position:0%
loaning it out to them okay mhm and then
eventually<00:10:25.410><c> we</c><00:10:25.799><c> would</c><00:10:26.009><c> just</c><00:10:26.459><c> basically</c>

00:10:26.569 --> 00:10:26.579 align:start position:0%
eventually we would just basically
 

00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:29.509 align:start position:0%
eventually we would just basically
charge<00:10:27.209><c> them</c><00:10:27.749><c> enough</c><00:10:28.499><c> money</c><00:10:28.740><c> to</c><00:10:28.920><c> cover</c><00:10:29.100><c> the</c>

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
charge them enough money to cover the
 

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:31.369 align:start position:0%
charge them enough money to cover the

00:10:31.369 --> 00:10:31.379 align:start position:0%
hardware costs yeah and then did you
 

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
hardware costs yeah and then did you
sort<00:10:31.589><c> of</c><00:10:31.649><c> have</c><00:10:31.829><c> to</c><00:10:31.949><c> sit</c><00:10:32.220><c> down</c><00:10:32.490><c> with</c><00:10:32.699><c> each</c><00:10:32.759><c> one</c>

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:39.340 align:start position:0%
single speaker just talked about in us I
 

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
single speaker just talked about in us I
mean<00:17:39.520><c> we're</c><00:17:39.640><c> assuming</c><00:17:39.790><c> today</c><00:17:40.270><c> as</c><00:17:40.450><c> well</c><00:17:40.750><c> yeah</c>

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:41.050 align:start position:0%
mean we're assuming today as well yeah
 

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
mean we're assuming today as well yeah
and<00:17:41.410><c> so</c><00:17:42.000><c> it</c><00:17:43.000><c> would</c><00:17:43.180><c> take</c><00:17:43.360><c> us</c><00:17:43.510><c> years</c><00:17:44.050><c> before</c><00:17:44.560><c> we</c>

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:44.890 align:start position:0%
and so it would take us years before we
 

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.180 align:start position:0%

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
force manhandling woman handling these
problems<00:27:03.020><c> and</c><00:27:03.290><c> this</c><00:27:03.410><c> work</c><00:27:03.650><c> to</c><00:27:04.310><c> get</c><00:27:04.400><c> it</c><00:27:04.550><c> done</c>

and so I guess that's my thoughts there
 

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
and so I guess that's my thoughts there
certainly<00:27:08.810><c> like</c><00:27:10.810><c> especially</c><00:27:11.810><c> now</c><00:27:11.990><c> I</c><00:27:12.020><c> mean</c><00:27:12.320><c> we</c>

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:19.150 align:start position:0%
it's challenging something's
all-consuming<00:41:18.109><c> but</c><00:41:18.319><c> you</c><00:41:18.410><c> have</c><00:41:18.529><c> like</c><00:41:18.680><c> a</c><00:41:18.710><c> larger</c>

00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:02.329 align:start position:0%
conversations and all this work that
 

00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:04.809 align:start position:0%
conversations and all this work that
wasn't<00:43:02.660><c> actually</c><00:43:02.839><c> moving</c><00:43:03.470><c> the</c><00:43:03.950><c> startup</c><00:43:04.520><c> in</c><00:43:04.730><c> a</c>

00:43:04.809 --> 00:43:04.819 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually moving the startup in a
 

00:43:04.819 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually moving the startup in a
better<00:43:05.000><c> direction</c><00:43:05.569><c> I</c><00:43:05.690><c> was</c><00:43:05.839><c> just</c><00:43:05.990><c> doing</c><00:43:06.410><c> this</c>

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:06.530 align:start position:0%
better direction I was just doing this
 

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.370 align:start position:0%
better direction I was just doing this
work<00:43:06.770><c> and</c><00:43:07.010><c> so</c><00:43:07.099><c> I</c><00:43:07.910><c> think</c><00:43:08.119><c> prioritization</c><00:43:08.839><c> is</c>

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:09.380 align:start position:0%
work and so I think prioritization is
 

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:13.270 align:start position:0%
work and so I think prioritization is
what<00:43:10.310><c> all</c><00:43:10.760><c> people</c><00:43:11.329><c> get</c><00:43:11.599><c> wrong</c><00:43:11.950><c> but</c><00:43:12.950><c> that</c><00:43:13.130><c> can</c>

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
what all people get wrong but that can
 

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.059 align:start position:0%
what all people get wrong but that can
be<00:43:13.310><c> corrected</c><00:43:13.609><c> right</c><00:43:14.000><c> by</c><00:43:14.300><c> really</c><00:43:15.230><c> taking</c><00:43:15.800><c> an</c>
