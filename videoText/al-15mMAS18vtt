and then that screens out a lot of this
junk<00:12:12.959><c> because</c><00:12:13.079><c> the</c><00:12:13.240><c> low</c><00:12:13.519><c> effort</c><00:12:14.160><c> pivots</c><00:12:15.160><c> if</c>

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
describe that version yeah have you
 

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.389 align:start position:0%
describe that version yeah have you
heard<00:14:03.360><c> the</c><00:14:03.440><c> term</c><00:14:03.880><c> random</c><00:14:04.279><c> walk</c><00:14:04.680><c> people</c><00:14:05.120><c> like</c>

00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
heard the term random walk people like
 

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:07.990 align:start position:0%

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
random walk you actually never get
 

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.590 align:start position:0%
random walk you actually never get
anywhere<00:14:14.000><c> like</c><00:14:14.120><c> imagine</c><00:14:14.399><c> a</c><00:14:14.519><c> starting</c><00:14:14.959><c> point</c>

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
and then you walk one direction and you
 

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
and then you walk one direction and you
roll<00:14:17.680><c> the</c><00:14:17.800><c> dice</c><00:14:18.040><c> and</c><00:14:18.160><c> you</c><00:14:18.240><c> choose</c><00:14:18.440><c> a</c><00:14:18.560><c> different</c>

you're going to be lost at sea and so
 

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.269 align:start position:0%

you<00:14:43.839><c> kind</c><00:14:43.920><c> of</c><00:14:44.079><c> have</c><00:14:44.160><c> to</c><00:14:44.279><c> get</c><00:14:44.399><c> on</c><00:14:44.519><c> a</c><00:14:45.160><c> vector</c><00:14:46.160><c> that</c>

00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to get on a vector that
 

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:48.189 align:start position:0%
you kind of have to get on a vector that
even<00:14:46.440><c> if</c><00:14:46.519><c> you</c><00:14:46.639><c> have</c><00:14:46.720><c> to</c><00:14:46.839><c> change</c><00:14:47.160><c> a</c><00:14:47.279><c> little</c><00:14:47.519><c> bit</c>

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
yeah there's some forward progress
 

00:14:50.199 --> 00:14:52.470 align:start position:0%
yeah there's some forward progress
you're<00:14:50.360><c> making</c><00:14:50.639><c> in</c><00:14:50.839><c> some</c><00:14:51.079><c> specific</c><00:14:51.519><c> Direction</c>

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
you're making in some specific Direction
 

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.389 align:start position:0%
you're making in some specific Direction
and<00:14:52.600><c> I</c><00:14:52.759><c> think</c><00:14:53.079><c> that</c><00:14:53.440><c> what</c><00:14:53.600><c> we</c><00:14:53.759><c> see</c><00:14:54.040><c> that's</c><00:14:54.199><c> so</c>

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that what we see that's so
 

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:57.069 align:start position:0%
and I think that what we see that's so
unfortunate<00:14:55.040><c> is</c><00:14:55.320><c> that</c><00:14:56.240><c> when</c><00:14:56.399><c> you</c><00:14:56.560><c> do</c><00:14:56.839><c> that</c>

00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunate is that when you do that
 

00:14:57.079 --> 00:14:59.629 align:start position:0%
unfortunate is that when you do that
random<00:14:57.480><c> walk</c><00:14:58.000><c> enough</c><00:14:58.360><c> you</c><00:14:58.720><c> just</c><00:14:58.920><c> run</c><00:14:59.279><c> out</c><00:14:59.440><c> of</c>

00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
we're missing the V which is viable yeah
 

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.230 align:start position:0%
we're missing the V which is viable yeah
like<00:17:10.679><c> basically</c><00:17:11.120><c> if</c><00:17:11.240><c> it</c><00:17:11.360><c> doesn't</c><00:17:11.799><c> work</c><00:17:12.039><c> for</c>

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
like basically if it doesn't work for
 

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.069 align:start position:0%
like basically if it doesn't work for
anyone<00:17:13.160><c> yeah</c><00:17:13.919><c> how</c><00:17:14.160><c> it</c><00:17:14.280><c> is</c><00:17:14.439><c> hard</c><00:17:14.600><c> to</c><00:17:14.679><c> argue</c><00:17:14.919><c> that</c>

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
anyone yeah how it is hard to argue that
 

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
anyone yeah how it is hard to argue that
is<00:17:15.280><c> viable</c><00:17:15.959><c> no</c><00:17:16.799><c> and</c><00:17:16.959><c> like</c><00:17:17.319><c> shouldn't</c><00:17:18.000><c> an</c><00:17:18.199><c> MV</c><00:17:19.000><c> it</c>

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
is viable no and like shouldn't an MV it
 

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.069 align:start position:0%
is viable no and like shouldn't an MV it
seems<00:17:19.400><c> like</c><00:17:19.600><c> the</c><00:17:19.760><c> cool</c><00:17:20.000><c> thing</c><00:17:20.160><c> about</c><00:17:20.319><c> an</c><00:17:20.400><c> MVP</c>

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
seems like the cool thing about an MVP
 

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.510 align:start position:0%
seems like the cool thing about an MVP
is<00:17:21.199><c> you</c><00:17:21.319><c> can</c><00:17:21.480><c> do</c><00:17:21.679><c> things</c><00:17:21.839><c> that</c><00:17:22.000><c> don't</c><00:17:22.199><c> scale</c>

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
is you can do things that don't scale
 

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.470 align:start position:0%
is you can do things that don't scale
and<00:17:22.679><c> cheat</c><00:17:23.039><c> like</c><00:17:23.160><c> you</c><00:17:23.240><c> can</c><00:17:23.480><c> make</c><00:17:23.640><c> it</c><00:17:24.160><c> you</c><00:17:24.280><c> can</c>

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
and cheat like you can make it you can
 

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.750 align:start position:0%
and cheat like you can make it you can
kind<00:17:24.600><c> of</c><00:17:24.799><c> will</c><00:17:25.079><c> it</c><00:17:25.240><c> to</c><00:17:25.439><c> work</c><00:17:25.600><c> for</c><00:17:25.880><c> one</c><00:17:26.240><c> person</c>

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
kind of will it to work for one person
 

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.510 align:start position:0%
kind of will it to work for one person
right<00:17:27.160><c> so</c><00:17:27.360><c> the</c><00:17:27.520><c> fact</c><00:17:27.679><c> that</c><00:17:27.760><c> it</c><00:17:27.880><c> doesn't</c><00:17:28.120><c> work</c>

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
right so the fact that it doesn't work
 

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.470 align:start position:0%
right so the fact that it doesn't work
for<00:17:28.720><c> one</c><00:17:29.120><c> person</c><00:17:30.120><c> usually</c><00:17:30.600><c> means</c><00:17:31.080><c> that</c><00:17:31.280><c> like</c>

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
for one person usually means that like
 

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.470 align:start position:0%
for one person usually means that like
you<00:17:31.640><c> weren't</c><00:17:32.039><c> even</c><00:17:32.360><c> trying</c><00:17:32.760><c> to</c><00:17:32.960><c> make</c><00:17:33.120><c> it</c><00:17:33.280><c> work</c>

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
you weren't even trying to make it work
 

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.190 align:start position:0%
you weren't even trying to make it work
for<00:17:33.720><c> them</c><00:17:34.200><c> like</c><00:17:34.360><c> you</c><00:17:34.440><c> were</c><00:17:34.640><c> trying</c><00:17:34.919><c> to</c><00:17:35.080><c> do</c>
