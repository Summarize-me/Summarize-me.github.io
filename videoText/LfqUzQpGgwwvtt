00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:49.830 align:start position:0%
at it but what we do well is we
 

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.430 align:start position:0%
at it but what we do well is we
aggregate<00:13:50.310><c> everything</c><00:13:50.960><c> so</c><00:13:51.960><c> most</c><00:13:52.320><c> of</c><00:13:52.380><c> the</c>

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
aggregate everything so most of the

approach<00:13:54.060><c> so</c><00:13:54.390><c> they</c><00:13:54.510><c> can</c><00:13:54.630><c> only</c><00:13:54.720><c> ship</c><00:13:54.960><c> to</c><00:13:54.990><c> one</c>

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%

00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
vision for this which is great but I
 

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:27.740 align:start position:0%
