00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.969 align:start position:0%
actually smart it wasn't just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I think it's obvious that now ai is
 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.730 align:start position:0%
so I think it's obvious that now ai is
clearly<00:06:09.000><c> going</c><00:06:09.180><c> to</c><00:06:09.300><c> be</c><00:06:09.419><c> a</c><00:06:09.539><c> tool</c><00:06:09.840><c> as</c><00:06:10.139><c> impactful</c>

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 align:start position:0%
clearly going to be a tool as impactful
 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.270 align:start position:0%
clearly going to be a tool as impactful
as<00:06:11.340><c> mobile</c><00:06:11.639><c> or</c><00:06:12.300><c> open</c><00:06:12.479><c> source</c><00:06:13.020><c> back-ends</c><00:06:13.680><c> or</c>

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.270 align:start position:0%
cloud Computing and then we'll see from
there<00:06:17.940><c> right</c><00:06:18.419><c> like</c><00:06:18.660><c> LMS</c><00:06:19.259><c> are</c><00:06:19.500><c> clearly</c><00:06:19.860><c> that</c>

apps that wasn't the big business I
 

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.329 align:start position:0%
apps that wasn't the big business I
would<00:10:39.959><c> argue</c><00:10:40.200><c> maybe</c><00:10:40.620><c> the</c><00:10:40.800><c> analogy</c><00:10:41.160><c> here</c><00:10:41.220><c> was</c>

00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
would argue maybe the analogy here was
 

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.730 align:start position:0%
would argue maybe the analogy here was
the<00:10:41.399><c> like</c><00:10:41.880><c> it</c><00:10:42.360><c> was</c><00:10:42.480><c> obvious</c><00:10:42.839><c> that</c><00:10:43.200><c> Maps</c><00:10:43.620><c> were</c>

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
the like it was obvious that Maps were
 

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.430 align:start position:0%
the like it was obvious that Maps were
going<00:10:43.860><c> to</c><00:10:44.040><c> come</c><00:10:44.160><c> to</c><00:10:44.459><c> the</c><00:10:44.760><c> phone</c><00:10:45.300><c> yeah</c><00:10:45.779><c> it</c>

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
going to come to the phone yeah it
 

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.370 align:start position:0%
going to come to the phone yeah it
wasn't<00:10:46.740><c> obvious</c><00:10:47.279><c> that</c><00:10:47.700><c> Uber</c><00:10:48.300><c> was</c><00:10:48.839><c> gonna</c><00:10:49.140><c> come</c>

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
wasn't obvious that Uber was gonna come
 

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.250 align:start position:0%
wasn't obvious that Uber was gonna come
right<00:10:49.860><c> and</c><00:10:50.760><c> so</c><00:10:50.940><c> it</c><00:10:51.060><c> was</c><00:10:51.240><c> like</c><00:10:51.420><c> never</c><00:10:51.839><c> never</c>

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
right and so it was like never never
 

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.290 align:start position:0%
right and so it was like never never
would<00:10:52.560><c> have</c><00:10:52.620><c> imagined</c><00:10:53.100><c> and</c><00:10:53.760><c> so</c><00:10:53.880><c> I</c><00:10:54.060><c> definitely</c>

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
would have imagined and so I definitely
 

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.509 align:start position:0%
would have imagined and so I definitely
think<00:10:54.660><c> that</c><00:10:54.839><c> if</c><00:10:55.620><c> you</c><00:10:55.740><c> can</c><00:10:55.860><c> think</c><00:10:56.040><c> second</c><00:10:56.220><c> order</c>

00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
think that if you can think second order
 

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:58.730 align:start position:0%
think that if you can think second order
and<00:10:56.760><c> I'll</c><00:10:57.240><c> even</c><00:10:57.420><c> I'll</c><00:10:57.720><c> even</c><00:10:57.839><c> be</c><00:10:58.019><c> charitable</c><00:10:58.440><c> I</c>

00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
and I'll even I'll even be charitable I
 

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.170 align:start position:0%
and I'll even I'll even be charitable I
think<00:10:58.860><c> sometimes</c><00:10:59.339><c> to</c><00:10:59.579><c> think</c><00:10:59.700><c> second</c><00:10:59.940><c> order</c>

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
think sometimes to think second order
 

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.910 align:start position:0%
think sometimes to think second order
you<00:11:00.420><c> think</c><00:11:00.600><c> first</c><00:11:00.779><c> order</c><00:11:01.019><c> it's</c><00:11:01.320><c> it's</c><00:11:01.500><c> okay</c><00:11:01.740><c> if</c>

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
you think first order it's it's okay if
 

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.769 align:start position:0%
you think first order it's it's okay if
your<00:11:02.100><c> thing</c><00:11:02.279><c> starts</c><00:11:02.519><c> as</c><00:11:02.640><c> a</c><00:11:02.760><c> toy</c><00:11:03.060><c> like</c><00:11:03.660><c> when</c>
