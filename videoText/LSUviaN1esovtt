00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
for about a week I I tried to get more
 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.509 align:start position:0%
for about a week I I tried to get more
Equity<00:02:58.840><c> but</c><00:02:58.920><c> it</c><00:02:59.000><c> turns</c><00:02:59.159><c> out</c><00:02:59.280><c> you</c><00:02:59.360><c> have</c><00:02:59.440><c> to</c>

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
Equity but it turns out you have to
 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.430 align:start position:0%
Equity but it turns out you have to
negot<00:02:59.800><c> appreciate</c><00:03:00.200><c> before</c><00:03:00.720><c> accepting</c><00:03:01.800><c> um</c><00:03:02.800><c> so</c>

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
negot appreciate before accepting um so
 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.350 align:start position:0%
negot appreciate before accepting um so
but<00:03:03.560><c> yeah</c><00:03:03.680><c> it</c><00:03:03.799><c> was</c><00:03:04.440><c> it</c><00:03:04.560><c> had</c><00:03:04.680><c> a</c><00:03:04.840><c> very</c><00:03:05.080><c> kind</c><00:03:05.200><c> of</c>

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
but yeah it was it had a very kind of
 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.990 align:start position:0%
but yeah it was it had a very kind of
unreal<00:03:06.040><c> sense</c><00:03:06.560><c> of</c><00:03:06.959><c> like</c><00:03:07.959><c> just</c><00:03:08.480><c> excitement</c><00:03:08.920><c> you</c>

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the query logs and I would
 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.550 align:start position:0%
looking at the query logs and I would

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
this problem like a third of the queries
 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:03.430 align:start position:0%
this problem like a third of the queries
were<00:06:02.280><c> misspelled</c><00:06:02.759><c> or</c><00:06:02.880><c> something</c><00:06:03.160><c> like</c><00:06:03.319><c> that</c>

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
were misspelled or something like that
 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.590 align:start position:0%
were misspelled or something like that

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
so it was like the easiest quality win
 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
so it was like the easiest quality win

did you mean feature um and so but I

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
built it just based off of kind of an
 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.270 align:start position:0%
built it just based off of kind of an

existing spell corrector library and
 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.870 align:start position:0%
existing spell corrector library and
then<00:06:19.560><c> but</c><00:06:19.680><c> it</c><00:06:19.759><c> would</c><00:06:19.960><c> give</c><00:06:20.199><c> really</c><00:06:20.479><c> dumb</c>

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
then but it would give really dumb
 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.670 align:start position:0%
then but it would give really dumb
Corrections<00:06:21.440><c> like</c><00:06:21.599><c> if</c><00:06:21.680><c> you</c><00:06:21.800><c> typed</c><00:06:22.039><c> in</c><00:06:22.199><c> Turbo</c>

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
Corrections like if you typed in Turbo
 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.070 align:start position:0%

Tax<00:06:23.319><c> it</c><00:06:23.400><c> would</c><00:06:23.599><c> try</c><00:06:23.759><c> to</c><00:06:23.880><c> correct</c><00:06:24.120><c> it</c><00:06:24.199><c> to</c><00:06:24.400><c> turbot</c>

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
Tax it would try to correct it to turbot
 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.390 align:start position:0%
Tax it would try to correct it to turbot
axe<00:06:25.880><c> turbot</c><00:06:26.319><c> being</c><00:06:26.520><c> a</c><00:06:26.639><c> type</c><00:06:26.800><c> of</c><00:06:27.080><c> fish</c><00:06:28.080><c> um</c><00:06:28.280><c> and</c>

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
axe turbot being a type of fish um and
 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.990 align:start position:0%
axe turbot being a type of fish um and
so<00:06:28.680><c> I</c><00:06:28.840><c> I</c><00:06:28.960><c> did</c><00:06:29.160><c> some</c><00:06:29.639><c> basic</c><00:06:30.080><c> like</c><00:06:30.319><c> statistical</c>

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
so I I did some basic like statistical
 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.990 align:start position:0%
so I I did some basic like statistical

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
idiotic correction don't show it and so
 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.110 align:start position:0%
idiotic correction don't show it and so
I<00:06:35.039><c> would</c><00:06:35.240><c> just</c><00:06:35.360><c> like</c><00:06:35.520><c> filter</c><00:06:35.960><c> the</c><00:06:36.120><c> results</c><00:06:37.000><c> and</c>

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
I would just like filter the results and
 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.270 align:start position:0%
I would just like filter the results and

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.110 align:start position:0%
potential to disrupt that but I think
even<00:10:02.240><c> more</c><00:10:02.480><c> than</c><00:10:02.720><c> that</c><00:10:03.120><c> it</c><00:10:03.279><c> has</c><00:10:03.560><c> the</c><00:10:03.720><c> potential</c>

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
even more than that it has the potential
 

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.230 align:start position:0%
even more than that it has the potential

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
to completely um anger Regulators um and
 

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.509 align:start position:0%
to completely um anger Regulators um and
so<00:10:08.839><c> a</c><00:10:08.959><c> lot</c><00:10:09.160><c> of</c><00:10:09.399><c> Google's</c><00:10:09.839><c> business</c><00:10:10.200><c> is</c><00:10:10.360><c> just</c>

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
so a lot of Google's business is just
 

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:13.269 align:start position:0%
so a lot of Google's business is just
dealing<00:10:10.880><c> with</c><00:10:11.120><c> regulators</c><00:10:12.120><c> and</c><00:10:12.279><c> so</c><00:10:13.000><c> you</c><00:10:13.120><c> know</c>

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.509 align:start position:0%
dealing with regulators and so you know
we<00:10:13.399><c> know</c><00:10:13.640><c> if</c><00:10:13.720><c> you</c><00:10:13.880><c> put</c><00:10:14.040><c> out</c><00:10:14.200><c> an</c><00:10:14.440><c> AI</c><00:10:14.880><c> it's</c>

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
we know if you put out an AI it's
 

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
we know if you put out an AI it's
definitely<00:10:15.920><c> going</c><00:10:16.040><c> to</c><00:10:16.200><c> say</c><00:10:16.440><c> offensive</c><00:10:16.920><c> things</c>

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
definitely going to say offensive things
 

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.110 align:start position:0%
definitely going to say offensive things
and<00:10:17.880><c> so</c><00:10:18.279><c> I</c><00:10:18.440><c> I</c><00:10:18.519><c> think</c><00:10:18.920><c> they</c><00:10:19.040><c> were</c><00:10:19.800><c> kind</c><00:10:19.920><c> of</c>

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
and so I I think they were kind of
 

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.310 align:start position:0%
and so I I think they were kind of
terrified<00:10:20.720><c> of</c><00:10:20.959><c> that</c><00:10:21.600><c> and</c><00:10:21.720><c> so</c><00:10:22.040><c> even</c><00:10:22.360><c> internally</c>

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
terrified of that and so even internally
 

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
terrified of that and so even internally
uh<00:10:23.560><c> when</c><00:10:23.720><c> they</c><00:10:23.800><c> were</c><00:10:23.959><c> developing</c><00:10:24.839><c> um</c><00:10:25.200><c> you</c><00:10:25.320><c> know</c>

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
change the name because the original
 

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.150 align:start position:0%
change the name because the original

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:08.829 align:start position:0%
so they were just extremely risk averse
I<00:11:06.920><c> think</c><00:11:07.079><c> is</c><00:11:07.279><c> the</c><00:11:07.440><c> answer</c><00:11:08.200><c> and</c><00:11:08.440><c> how</c><00:11:08.600><c> do</c><00:11:08.720><c> you</c>

00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
I think is the answer and how do you
 

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:09.790 align:start position:0%
I think is the answer and how do you
think<00:11:08.959><c> it</c><00:11:09.040><c> would</c><00:11:09.160><c> have</c><00:11:09.279><c> been</c><00:11:09.399><c> different</c><00:11:09.680><c> if</c>

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
think it would have been different if
 

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.710 align:start position:0%
think it would have been different if

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
Sergey lari was still in charge and
 

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.629 align:start position:0%
Sergey lari was still in charge and

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
pushing forward I mean I think they can
 

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:17.590 align:start position:0%

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.870 align:start position:0%
I think that if given the chance Google

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%

you<00:11:33.680><c> know</c><00:11:33.839><c> put</c><00:11:34.000><c> out</c><00:11:34.120><c> chat</c><00:11:34.399><c> GPT</c><00:11:34.920><c> and</c><00:11:35.079><c> suddenly</c>

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
you know put out chat GPT and suddenly
 

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.310 align:start position:0%
you know put out chat GPT and suddenly
it<00:11:35.680><c> became</c><00:11:36.279><c> a</c><00:11:36.399><c> thing</c><00:11:36.560><c> that</c><00:11:36.680><c> they</c><00:11:36.760><c> were</c><00:11:36.920><c> forced</c>

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
it became a thing that they were forced
 

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.230 align:start position:0%
it became a thing that they were forced
to<00:11:37.480><c> do</c><00:11:38.000><c> and</c><00:11:38.160><c> that</c><00:11:38.320><c> also</c><00:11:38.519><c> helped</c><00:11:38.800><c> them</c><00:11:38.959><c> too</c>

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
to do and that also helped them too
 

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.590 align:start position:0%

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
say where you could finally see that AI
 

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.269 align:start position:0%
say where you could finally see that AI
was<00:12:22.600><c> real</c><00:12:23.279><c> right</c><00:12:23.480><c> so</c><00:12:23.720><c> so</c><00:12:23.920><c> for</c><00:12:24.279><c> decades</c><00:12:24.760><c> AI</c><00:12:25.120><c> was</c>

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
was real right so so for decades AI was
 

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:27.389 align:start position:0%
was real right so so for decades AI was
kind<00:12:25.399><c> of</c><00:12:25.519><c> the</c><00:12:25.720><c> Sci-Fi</c><00:12:26.279><c> thing</c><00:12:26.880><c> and</c><00:12:27.000><c> you</c><00:12:27.120><c> had</c><00:12:27.240><c> all</c>

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399 align:start position:0%
kind of the Sci-Fi thing and you had all
 

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:29.389 align:start position:0%
kind of the Sci-Fi thing and you had all
the<00:12:27.560><c> symbolic</c><00:12:28.040><c> AI</c><00:12:28.399><c> which</c><00:12:28.800><c> I</c><00:12:28.880><c> would</c><00:12:29.000><c> say</c><00:12:29.279><c> is</c>

00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
the symbolic AI which I would say is
 

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:31.550 align:start position:0%
the symbolic AI which I would say is
kind<00:12:29.480><c> of</c><00:12:29.600><c> like</c><00:12:29.760><c> garbage</c><00:12:30.480><c> and</c><00:12:30.600><c> so</c><00:12:30.839><c> finally</c><00:12:31.199><c> AI</c>

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
kind of like garbage and so finally AI
 

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.069 align:start position:0%
kind of like garbage and so finally AI
was<00:12:31.720><c> doing</c><00:12:31.959><c> something</c><00:12:32.199><c> that</c><00:12:32.320><c> was</c><00:12:32.480><c> like</c><00:12:32.600><c> truly</c>

00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
was doing something that was like truly
 

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:36.670 align:start position:0%
was doing something that was like truly

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.350 align:start position:0%

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.710 align:start position:0%
people and so he had uh I think been at
one<00:12:43.880><c> of</c><00:12:44.000><c> these</c><00:12:44.120><c> things</c><00:12:44.360><c> where</c><00:12:44.600><c> Elon</c><00:12:45.160><c> was</c><00:12:45.560><c> was</c>

one of these things where Elon was was
 

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.389 align:start position:0%
one of these things where Elon was was
very<00:12:47.720><c> you</c><00:12:47.959><c> essentially</c><00:12:48.600><c> ringing</c><00:12:49.000><c> the</c><00:12:49.120><c> alarm</c>

00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:51.550 align:start position:0%

Bell<00:12:49.680><c> say</c><00:12:49.920><c> AI</c><00:12:50.199><c> was</c><00:12:50.320><c> going</c><00:12:50.440><c> to</c><00:12:50.560><c> kill</c><00:12:50.760><c> us</c><00:12:50.920><c> all</c><00:12:51.320><c> and</c>

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
Bell say AI was going to kill us all and

should<00:12:53.880><c> be</c><00:12:54.040><c> regulation</c><00:12:54.560><c> and</c><00:12:54.639><c> so</c><00:12:54.760><c> we're</c><00:12:55.000><c> having</c>

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
should be regulation and so we're having
 

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.629 align:start position:0%
should be regulation and so we're having
these<00:12:56.160><c> discussions</c><00:12:56.760><c> you</c><00:12:56.880><c> know</c><00:12:56.959><c> Sam's</c><00:12:57.320><c> asking</c>

00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
these discussions you know Sam's asking
 

00:12:57.639 --> 00:12:59.189 align:start position:0%
these discussions you know Sam's asking
like<00:12:57.760><c> do</c><00:12:57.839><c> you</c><00:12:57.959><c> think</c><00:12:58.079><c> we</c><00:12:58.199><c> should</c><00:12:58.399><c> push</c><00:12:58.600><c> for</c><00:12:58.760><c> AI</c>

00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
like do you think we should push for AI
 

00:12:59.199 --> 00:13:02.269 align:start position:0%
like do you think we should push for AI
regulation<00:12:59.959><c> and</c><00:13:00.399><c> um</c><00:13:01.120><c> yeah</c><00:13:01.320><c> I'm</c><00:13:01.480><c> of</c><00:13:02.120><c> the</c>

00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
regulation and um yeah I'm of the
 

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.389 align:start position:0%
regulation and um yeah I'm of the
opinion<00:13:02.600><c> that</c><00:13:02.800><c> that's</c><00:13:03.600><c> only</c><00:13:03.880><c> makes</c><00:13:04.160><c> things</c>

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
opinion that that's only makes things
 

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:06.829 align:start position:0%
opinion that that's only makes things
worse<00:13:04.720><c> cuz</c><00:13:04.880><c> I</c><00:13:04.959><c> don't</c><00:13:05.199><c> have</c><00:13:06.000><c> great</c><00:13:06.320><c> confidence</c>

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:06.839 align:start position:0%
worse cuz I don't have great confidence
 

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:09.990 align:start position:0%
worse cuz I don't have great confidence
in<00:13:07.000><c> our</c><00:13:07.519><c> um</c><00:13:08.519><c> elected</c><00:13:08.959><c> representatives</c><00:13:09.639><c> to</c><00:13:09.800><c> be</c>

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
in our um elected representatives to be
 

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.150 align:start position:0%
in our um elected representatives to be
you<00:13:10.079><c> know</c><00:13:10.279><c> Super</c><00:13:11.120><c> Wise</c><00:13:12.120><c> uh</c><00:13:12.279><c> and</c><00:13:12.680><c> forward</c>

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
you know Super Wise uh and forward
 

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.870 align:start position:0%
you know Super Wise uh and forward
thinking<00:13:13.639><c> and</c><00:13:13.720><c> so</c><00:13:14.040><c> my</c><00:13:14.240><c> argument</c><00:13:14.680><c> was</c><00:13:14.959><c> that</c><00:13:15.720><c> the</c>

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
thinking and so my argument was that the
 

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.829 align:start position:0%
thinking and so my argument was that the
better<00:13:16.160><c> thing</c><00:13:16.320><c> to</c><00:13:16.480><c> do</c><00:13:16.720><c> would</c><00:13:16.880><c> be</c><00:13:17.079><c> that</c><00:13:17.560><c> we</c>

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
better thing to do would be that we
 

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.870 align:start position:0%
better thing to do would be that we
actually<00:13:18.120><c> build</c><00:13:18.440><c> the</c><00:13:18.639><c> AI</c><00:13:19.279><c> and</c><00:13:19.920><c> um</c><00:13:20.519><c> you</c><00:13:20.639><c> know</c>

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
actually build the AI and um you know
 

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.269 align:start position:0%
actually build the AI and um you know
that<00:13:21.000><c> way</c><00:13:21.160><c> we're</c><00:13:21.360><c> able</c><00:13:21.560><c> to</c><00:13:21.720><c> influence</c><00:13:22.160><c> the</c>

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
that way we're able to influence the
 

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:24.550 align:start position:0%
that way we're able to influence the
direction<00:13:22.639><c> that</c><00:13:22.760><c> it</c><00:13:22.880><c> goes</c><00:13:23.760><c> um</c><00:13:23.880><c> but</c><00:13:24.040><c> AI</c><00:13:24.399><c> was</c>

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
direction that it goes um but AI was
 

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.189 align:start position:0%
direction that it goes um but AI was
still<00:13:24.800><c> at</c><00:13:25.000><c> that</c><00:13:25.199><c> time</c><00:13:25.639><c> something</c><00:13:25.959><c> that</c><00:13:26.079><c> we</c>

00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
still at that time something that we
 

00:13:26.199 --> 00:13:27.750 align:start position:0%
still at that time something that we
didn't<00:13:26.399><c> really</c><00:13:26.600><c> know</c><00:13:26.880><c> what</c><00:13:27.000><c> the</c><00:13:27.199><c> time</c><00:13:27.480><c> frame</c>

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
didn't really know what the time frame
 

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.870 align:start position:0%
didn't really know what the time frame
would<00:13:27.959><c> be</c><00:13:28.480><c> to</c><00:13:28.639><c> be</c><00:13:28.720><c> able</c><00:13:28.880><c> to</c><00:13:29.320><c> have</c><00:13:29.480><c> Revenue</c>

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
would be to be able to have Revenue
 

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.990 align:start position:0%
would be to be able to have Revenue
because<00:13:30.000><c> it</c><00:13:30.079><c> was</c><00:13:30.240><c> still</c><00:13:30.480><c> basically</c><00:13:30.839><c> a</c>

00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
the long-term trajectory of AI it's the
 

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:45.870 align:start position:0%
the long-term trajectory of AI it's the

00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
invented um and so the question is like
 

00:14:47.959 --> 00:14:50.430 align:start position:0%
invented um and so the question is like
where<00:14:48.120><c> does</c><00:14:48.360><c> that</c><00:14:48.560><c> power</c><00:14:48.959><c> go</c><00:14:49.920><c> and</c><00:14:50.160><c> I</c><00:14:50.279><c> think</c>

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
where does that power go and I think

there's essentially two directions you

there's essentially two directions you

like a subsidiary of YC called YC
research<00:17:40.120><c> right</c><00:17:40.240><c> so</c><00:17:40.360><c> the</c><00:17:40.520><c> original</c><00:17:41.000><c> the</c>

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%

research right so the original the

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
original concept I think was that it was
 

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.630 align:start position:0%
original concept I think was that it was
actually<00:17:42.919><c> be</c><00:17:43.320><c> part</c><00:17:43.559><c> of</c><00:17:44.120><c> this</c><00:17:44.280><c> thing</c><00:17:44.440><c> that</c><00:17:44.520><c> we</c>

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
actually be part of this thing that we
 

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.830 align:start position:0%
actually be part of this thing that we
were<00:17:44.760><c> calling</c><00:17:45.120><c> YC</c><00:17:45.520><c> research</c><00:17:46.400><c> and</c><00:17:46.520><c> then</c><00:17:46.720><c> I</c>

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
were calling YC research and then I
 

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.789 align:start position:0%
were calling YC research and then I
think<00:17:47.200><c> kind</c><00:17:47.320><c> of</c><00:17:47.480><c> like</c><00:17:47.720><c> as</c><00:17:47.919><c> Elon</c><00:17:48.360><c> got</c><00:17:48.520><c> more</c>

00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
think kind of like as Elon got more
 

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:51.669 align:start position:0%
think kind of like as Elon got more
involved<00:17:49.400><c> it</c><00:17:49.600><c> became</c><00:17:50.160><c> its</c><00:17:50.320><c> own</c><00:17:51.080><c> you</c><00:17:51.200><c> know</c><00:17:51.320><c> open</c>

00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
involved it became its own you know open
 

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:55.070 align:start position:0%

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
AI with kind of Elon more more of the

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
if you think about it if you can predict
 

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.190 align:start position:0%

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
predicted that's your prompt and then
 

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.870 align:start position:0%

the<00:20:35.000><c> next</c><00:20:35.200><c> word</c><00:20:35.440><c> is</c><00:20:35.600><c> the</c><00:20:35.760><c> prediction</c><00:20:36.559><c> right</c>

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
the next word is the prediction right
 

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
the next word is the prediction right

they're kind of behind in many ways

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
sort of weaken their competitors so

that is like the one of the fundamental

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
concerns I have which is that I think
 

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.750 align:start position:0%
concerns I have which is that I think

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.389 align:start position:0%

the path I think the the key point that
happened<00:30:24.360><c> is</c><00:30:24.559><c> we</c><00:30:24.760><c> crossed</c><00:30:25.120><c> the</c><00:30:25.279><c> line</c><00:30:25.559><c> where</c><00:30:25.799><c> AI</c>

really get much out to a thing where you
 

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.269 align:start position:0%
really get much out to a thing where you
you<00:30:32.600><c> put</c><00:30:32.760><c> in</c><00:30:32.919><c> money</c><00:30:33.399><c> and</c><00:30:33.559><c> then</c><00:30:33.679><c> you</c><00:30:33.840><c> get</c><00:30:34.000><c> out</c>

00:30:34.269 --> 00:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
you put in money and then you get out
 

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:37.710 align:start position:0%
you put in money and then you get out
more<00:30:35.120><c> um</c><00:30:35.320><c> and</c><00:30:35.480><c> so</c><00:30:36.159><c> it's</c><00:30:36.360><c> like</c><00:30:36.519><c> when</c><00:30:36.679><c> a</c><00:30:37.000><c> when</c><00:30:37.120><c> a</c>

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
more um and so it's like when a when a
 

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.430 align:start position:0%
more um and so it's like when a when a
reaction<00:30:38.440><c> you</c><00:30:38.519><c> know</c><00:30:38.720><c> like</c><00:30:38.840><c> a</c><00:30:39.000><c> like</c><00:30:39.279><c> goes</c>

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
reaction you know like a like goes
 

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.070 align:start position:0%
reaction you know like a like goes
critical<00:30:40.000><c> right</c><00:30:40.120><c> goes</c><00:30:40.320><c> critical</c><00:30:40.760><c> like</c><00:30:40.880><c> if</c><00:30:41.000><c> you</c>

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
critical right goes critical like if you
 

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.870 align:start position:0%
critical right goes critical like if you
have<00:30:41.200><c> a</c><00:30:41.360><c> plutonium</c><00:30:41.919><c> you</c><00:30:42.000><c> have</c><00:30:42.320><c> plutonium</c>

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
have a plutonium you have plutonium
 

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
have a plutonium you have plutonium
spheres<00:30:43.240><c> and</c><00:30:43.360><c> they're</c><00:30:43.480><c> kind</c><00:30:43.600><c> of</c><00:30:43.679><c> warm</c><00:30:43.960><c> and</c>

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
spheres and they're kind of warm and
 

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.310 align:start position:0%
spheres and they're kind of warm and
then<00:30:44.159><c> you</c><00:30:44.279><c> put</c><00:30:44.399><c> them</c><00:30:44.679><c> together</c><00:30:44.919><c> and</c><00:30:45.000><c> then</c><00:30:45.120><c> it</c>

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
then you put them together and then it
 

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.470 align:start position:0%
then you put them together and then it
explodes<00:30:46.200><c> or</c><00:30:46.320><c> when</c><00:30:46.480><c> darpet</c><00:30:47.080><c> became</c><00:30:47.320><c> the</c>

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
explodes or when darpet became the
 

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.789 align:start position:0%
explodes or when darpet became the

00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
internet moment right um and so right
 

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.549 align:start position:0%
internet moment right um and so right
and<00:30:49.919><c> so</c><00:30:50.360><c> right</c><00:30:50.519><c> the</c><00:30:50.600><c> internet</c><00:30:50.960><c> crossed</c><00:30:51.360><c> that</c>

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
build uh increase our electric supply to
 

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.190 align:start position:0%
build uh increase our electric supply to

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
like train the AI right it's become like
 

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.070 align:start position:0%
like train the AI right it's become like
a<00:31:14.399><c> national</c><00:31:14.840><c> security</c><00:31:15.399><c> thing</c><00:31:16.240><c> um</c><00:31:16.559><c> and</c><00:31:16.679><c> so</c><00:31:16.960><c> I</c>

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
a national security thing um and so I
 

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.629 align:start position:0%
a national security thing um and so I
think<00:31:17.360><c> once</c><00:31:17.720><c> that</c><00:31:18.000><c> happens</c><00:31:18.679><c> you</c><00:31:18.880><c> get</c><00:31:19.159><c> that</c>

I I think if you attach that kind of

that's that's really um important and
 

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.510 align:start position:0%
that's that's really um important and

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
and and and the authoritarian regime is
 

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.309 align:start position:0%
and and and the authoritarian regime is

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
inherently truth denying and so I they
 

00:41:52.319 --> 00:41:54.109 align:start position:0%
inherently truth denying and so I they
put<00:41:52.599><c> themselves</c><00:41:52.839><c> at</c><00:41:53.000><c> a</c><00:41:53.160><c> disadvantage</c><00:41:53.800><c> and</c>

00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
put themselves at a disadvantage and
 

00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:55.829 align:start position:0%
put themselves at a disadvantage and
hopefully<00:41:54.440><c> they</c><00:41:54.560><c> keep</c><00:41:54.880><c> themselves</c><00:41:55.200><c> there</c><00:41:55.680><c> so</c>

00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully they keep themselves there so
 

00:41:55.839 --> 00:41:57.470 align:start position:0%
