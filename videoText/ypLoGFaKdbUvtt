if no one else thinks our idea is good
maybe<00:13:40.620><c> at</c><00:13:40.770><c> least</c><00:13:40.860><c> someone</c><00:13:41.160><c> will</c><00:13:41.190><c> think</c><00:13:41.430><c> it's</c>

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
maybe at least someone will think it's

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:51.450 align:start position:0%
advice I think I've gotten since we
 

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.930 align:start position:0%
advice I think I've gotten since we

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
started the company which is we had too
 

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
started the company which is we had too
many<00:13:54.030><c> words</c><00:13:54.360><c> and</c><00:13:54.660><c> not</c><00:13:54.780><c> enough</c><00:13:55.050><c> information</c>

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:55.730 align:start position:0%
many words and not enough information
 

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.820 align:start position:0%
many words and not enough information
and<00:13:56.730><c> that</c><00:13:57.480><c> was</c><00:13:57.600><c> probably</c><00:13:57.990><c> because</c><00:13:58.200><c> we</c><00:13:58.470><c> didn't</c>

00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:58.830 align:start position:0%
and that was probably because we didn't
 

00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.900 align:start position:0%
and that was probably because we didn't
really<00:13:59.130><c> know</c><00:13:59.310><c> what</c><00:13:59.430><c> we</c><00:13:59.580><c> were</c><00:13:59.700><c> building</c>

00:13:59.900 --> 00:13:59.910 align:start position:0%

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.150 align:start position:0%
really know what we were building

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.610 align:start position:0%
ourselves and so we just kind of put a
