you to realize that yeah so I think it's
 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.609 align:start position:0%
you to realize that yeah so I think it's
a<00:02:08.280><c> multi-layered</c><00:02:08.580><c> kind</c><00:02:09.300><c> of</c><00:02:09.360><c> question</c><00:02:09.899><c> for</c><00:02:10.500><c> me</c>

even<00:02:13.030><c> from</c><00:02:13.150><c> the</c><00:02:13.210><c> beginning</c><00:02:13.390><c> I</c><00:02:13.960><c> I</c><00:02:14.380><c> knew</c><00:02:14.830><c> that</c>

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 align:start position:0%

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.010 align:start position:0%
even from the beginning I I knew that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 align:start position:0%
parts of it were against the odds and so

and<00:02:48.700><c> so</c><00:02:48.820><c> kind</c><00:02:49.120><c> of</c><00:02:49.239><c> like</c><00:02:49.360><c> a</c><00:02:49.660><c> mad</c><00:02:50.260><c> scientist</c><00:02:50.800><c> and</c>

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 align:start position:0%
and so kind of like a mad scientist and
 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
and so kind of like a mad scientist and
so<00:02:51.820><c> in</c><00:02:52.150><c> that</c><00:02:52.450><c> vein</c><00:02:52.870><c> I</c><00:02:53.290><c> knew</c><00:02:54.040><c> that</c><00:02:54.400><c> we</c><00:02:54.610><c> were</c><00:02:54.670><c> up</c>

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 align:start position:0%
so in that vein I knew that we were up
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.699 align:start position:0%
so in that vein I knew that we were up
against<00:02:55.360><c> kind</c><00:02:55.570><c> of</c><00:02:55.660><c> challenging</c><00:02:56.140><c> economics</c>

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 align:start position:0%
against kind of challenging economics
 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.430 align:start position:0%
against kind of challenging economics
but<00:02:56.980><c> I</c><00:02:57.130><c> always</c><00:02:57.400><c> thought</c><00:02:57.790><c> about</c><00:02:57.850><c> it</c><00:02:58.440><c> knowing</c>

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
but I always thought about it knowing
 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
but I always thought about it knowing
that<00:02:59.519><c> we</c><00:03:00.519><c> then</c><00:03:00.760><c> took</c><00:03:00.940><c> a</c><00:03:01.000><c> look</c><00:03:01.209><c> at</c><00:03:01.330><c> pricing</c><00:03:01.810><c> from</c>

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 align:start position:0%
that we then took a look at pricing from
 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
that we then took a look at pricing from
like<00:03:02.260><c> a</c><00:03:02.290><c> membership</c><00:03:02.739><c> model</c><00:03:02.920><c> and</c><00:03:03.280><c> and</c>

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 align:start position:0%
like a membership model and and

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 align:start position:0%
go into the details of that but it was

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 align:start position:0%
one had a higher frequency but you had
 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
one had a higher frequency but you had

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 align:start position:0%
decent margin on that frequency so that

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 align:start position:0%
was all the like what the hypotheses
 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.810 align:start position:0%
was all the like what the hypotheses
were<00:03:28.299><c> based</c><00:03:28.540><c> on</c><00:03:29.220><c> one</c><00:03:30.220><c> other</c><00:03:30.340><c> thing</c><00:03:30.610><c> that</c><00:03:30.640><c> I</c>

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 align:start position:0%
were based on one other thing that I
 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.449 align:start position:0%
were based on one other thing that I
think<00:03:31.180><c> is</c><00:03:31.720><c> important</c><00:03:32.170><c> to</c><00:03:32.200><c> note</c><00:03:32.410><c> is</c><00:03:32.560><c> that</c><00:03:32.590><c> what</c>

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 align:start position:0%
think is important to note is that what
 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.130 align:start position:0%
think is important to note is that what
it<00:03:33.610><c> looks</c><00:03:33.880><c> like</c><00:03:34.090><c> at</c><00:03:34.269><c> a</c><00:03:34.299><c> certain</c><00:03:34.660><c> scale</c><00:03:34.900><c> is</c><00:03:35.110><c> very</c>

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 align:start position:0%
it looks like at a certain scale is very
 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.449 align:start position:0%
it looks like at a certain scale is very
different<00:03:35.620><c> than</c><00:03:35.680><c> what</c><00:03:35.829><c> looks</c><00:03:35.980><c> like</c><00:03:36.040><c> even</c><00:03:36.370><c> at</c>

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 align:start position:0%
different than what looks like even at
 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.069 align:start position:0%

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
the next level and so what I mean by
 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
the next level and so what I mean by
that<00:03:38.110><c> is</c><00:03:38.380><c> when</c><00:03:38.950><c> you're</c><00:03:39.100><c> doing</c><00:03:39.310><c> 10</c><00:03:39.549><c> bookings</c><00:03:39.910><c> a</c>

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 align:start position:0%
that is when you're doing 10 bookings a

that is when you're doing 10 bookings a

week it looks like something with like
 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.039 align:start position:0%

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 align:start position:0%
maybe three caregivers and maybe you
 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
maybe three caregivers and maybe you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 align:start position:0%
you're starting to do a hundred bookings
 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.930 align:start position:0%
you're starting to do a hundred bookings
a<00:03:50.500><c> week</c><00:03:50.620><c> and</c><00:03:50.829><c> it</c><00:03:50.890><c> looks</c><00:03:51.040><c> different</c><00:03:51.400><c> yet</c><00:03:51.700><c> again</c>

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 align:start position:0%

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
a week and it looks different yet again
when<00:03:52.120><c> you're</c><00:03:52.239><c> doing</c><00:03:52.480><c> 500</c><00:03:52.959><c> bookings</c><00:03:53.230><c> a</c><00:03:53.320><c> week</c>

when you're doing 500 bookings a week
and<00:03:53.680><c> so</c><00:03:54.340><c> you</c><00:03:54.970><c> know</c><00:03:55.120><c> why</c><00:03:55.450><c> did</c><00:03:55.780><c> it</c><00:03:55.870><c> take</c><00:03:56.019><c> the</c>

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 align:start position:0%
and so you know why did it take the
 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
and so you know why did it take the
three<00:03:56.620><c> years</c><00:03:56.890><c> or</c><00:03:57.070><c> whatever</c><00:03:57.310><c> to</c><00:03:57.459><c> really</c>

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 align:start position:0%
understand that is because every single
 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
understand that is because every single

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 align:start position:0%

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 align:start position:0%

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:41.370 align:start position:0%
the mind towards revenue so we certainly
 

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
the mind towards revenue so we certainly
weren't<00:10:41.730><c> profitable</c><00:10:42.600><c> but</c><00:10:42.870><c> we</c><00:10:43.020><c> were</c><00:10:43.110><c> always</c>

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:43.290 align:start position:0%
weren't profitable but we were always
 

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
weren't profitable but we were always
making<00:10:43.800><c> revenue</c><00:10:44.220><c> and</c><00:10:44.460><c> I</c><00:10:44.550><c> think</c><00:10:44.790><c> that's</c><00:10:44.970><c> also</c>

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.210 align:start position:0%
making revenue and I think that's also
 

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
making revenue and I think that's also
important<00:10:45.630><c> because</c><00:10:45.750><c> it</c><00:10:45.960><c> was</c><00:10:46.020><c> able</c><00:10:46.410><c> I</c><00:10:46.650><c> was</c><00:10:46.950><c> able</c>

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.130 align:start position:0%
important because it was able I was able
 

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.860 align:start position:0%
important because it was able I was able
to<00:10:47.160><c> then</c><00:10:47.370><c> take</c><00:10:47.700><c> the</c><00:10:47.970><c> little</c><00:10:48.390><c> bit</c><00:10:48.540><c> over</c><00:10:48.720><c> two</c>

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:48.870 align:start position:0%
to then take the little bit over two
 

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.660 align:start position:0%
to then take the little bit over two
million<00:10:49.050><c> that</c><00:10:49.260><c> we</c><00:10:49.380><c> raised</c><00:10:49.620><c> and</c><00:10:50.040><c> have</c><00:10:50.460><c> that</c>

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:50.670 align:start position:0%
million that we raised and have that
 

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.450 align:start position:0%
million that we raised and have that
last<00:10:50.940><c> over</c><00:10:51.480><c> I</c><00:10:51.810><c> think</c><00:10:52.110><c> like</c><00:10:52.410><c> three</c><00:10:52.680><c> years</c><00:10:52.710><c> and</c><00:10:53.430><c> I</c>

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
last over I think like three years and I
 

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
last over I think like three years and I
think<00:10:53.520><c> that's</c><00:10:53.730><c> just</c><00:10:53.820><c> important</c><00:10:54.210><c> because</c><00:10:54.330><c> that</c>

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:54.690 align:start position:0%
think that's just important because that
 

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
think that's just important because that
bought<00:10:54.960><c> us</c><00:10:54.990><c> the</c><00:10:55.290><c> time</c><00:10:55.620><c> then</c><00:10:56.160><c> if</c><00:10:56.670><c> we</c><00:10:57.480><c> weren't</c>

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:57.690 align:start position:0%
bought us the time then if we weren't
 

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.090 align:start position:0%
bought us the time then if we weren't
growing<00:10:57.960><c> necessarily</c><00:10:58.560><c> as</c><00:10:58.650><c> fast</c><00:10:58.860><c> that</c><00:10:58.980><c> bought</c>

00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
growing necessarily as fast that bought
 

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.530 align:start position:0%
growing necessarily as fast that bought
us<00:10:59.190><c> the</c><00:10:59.310><c> time</c><00:10:59.430><c> for</c><00:10:59.490><c> more</c><00:10:59.730><c> experiments</c><00:11:00.300><c> yeah</c>

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
us the time for more experiments yeah
 

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.150 align:start position:0%
us the time for more experiments yeah
and<00:11:00.720><c> so</c><00:11:00.960><c> that's</c><00:11:01.290><c> the</c><00:11:01.500><c> way</c><00:11:01.590><c> I</c><00:11:01.620><c> thought</c><00:11:01.890><c> about</c>

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
and so that's the way I thought about
 

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's the way I thought about
that<00:11:02.810><c> the</c><00:11:03.810><c> writing</c><00:11:04.290><c> was</c><00:11:04.320><c> starting</c><00:11:05.070><c> to</c><00:11:05.100><c> be</c>

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:05.370 align:start position:0%
that the writing was starting to be
 

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.870 align:start position:0%
that the writing was starting to be
written<00:11:05.610><c> on</c><00:11:05.730><c> the</c><00:11:05.760><c> wall</c><00:11:06.060><c> and</c>

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
written on the wall and
 

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.370 align:start position:0%
written on the wall and
for<00:11:07.030><c> me</c><00:11:07.180><c> I</c><00:11:07.480><c> wasn't</c><00:11:07.840><c> done</c><00:11:08.110><c> with</c><00:11:08.260><c> the</c>

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:08.380 align:start position:0%
for me I wasn't done with the
 

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
for me I wasn't done with the
experiments<00:11:09.070><c> right</c><00:11:09.220><c> so</c><00:11:09.370><c> I</c><00:11:09.400><c> still</c><00:11:09.790><c> thought</c>

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.030 align:start position:0%
experiments right so I still thought
 

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
experiments right so I still thought
there<00:11:10.150><c> was</c><00:11:10.330><c> you</c><00:11:10.900><c> know</c><00:11:10.990><c> maybe</c><00:11:11.140><c> we</c><00:11:11.320><c> could</c><00:11:11.440><c> do</c>

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:11.590 align:start position:0%
there was you know maybe we could do
 

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.990 align:start position:0%
there was you know maybe we could do
poppy<00:11:11.830><c> pool</c><00:11:12.130><c> which</c><00:11:12.340><c> is</c><00:11:12.370><c> you</c><00:11:12.580><c> know</c><00:11:12.700><c> pair</c>

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
poppy pool which is you know pair
 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
poppy pool which is you know pair
parents<00:11:13.540><c> or</c><00:11:13.720><c> pair</c><00:11:14.080><c> of</c><00:11:14.170><c> kids</c><00:11:14.350><c> together</c><00:11:14.560><c> and</c><00:11:14.890><c> get</c>

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.010 align:start position:0%
parents or pair of kids together and get
 

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
parents or pair of kids together and get
a<00:11:15.040><c> little</c><00:11:15.280><c> bit</c><00:11:15.400><c> of</c><00:11:15.460><c> leverage</c><00:11:15.610><c> out</c><00:11:15.880><c> there</c><00:11:16.090><c> and</c>

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.210 align:start position:0%
a little bit of leverage out there and
 

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit of leverage out there and
make<00:11:16.660><c> it</c><00:11:16.690><c> cheaper</c><00:11:17.110><c> I</c><00:11:17.260><c> thought</c><00:11:18.070><c> we</c><00:11:18.190><c> could</c><00:11:18.310><c> use</c>

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:18.370 align:start position:0%
make it cheaper I thought we could use
 

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
make it cheaper I thought we could use
stay-at-home<00:11:19.150><c> parents</c><00:11:19.780><c> as</c><00:11:19.930><c> another</c><00:11:20.380><c> tier</c>

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:20.770 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home parents as another tier
 

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home parents as another tier
because<00:11:21.130><c> there</c><00:11:21.280><c> are</c><00:11:21.340><c> people</c><00:11:21.460><c> that</c><00:11:21.730><c> live</c>

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:21.910 align:start position:0%
because there are people that live
 

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
because there are people that live
within<00:11:22.240><c> the</c><00:11:22.420><c> community</c><00:11:22.900><c> and</c><00:11:23.050><c> so</c><00:11:23.200><c> maybe</c><00:11:23.380><c> you</c>

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:23.530 align:start position:0%
within the community and so maybe you
 

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.250 align:start position:0%
within the community and so maybe you
won't<00:11:23.710><c> see</c><00:11:23.980><c> the</c><00:11:24.130><c> same</c><00:11:24.340><c> amount</c><00:11:24.670><c> of</c><00:11:24.880><c> churn</c><00:11:25.540><c> hmm</c>

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:26.260 align:start position:0%
won't see the same amount of churn hmm
 

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
won't see the same amount of churn hmm
so<00:11:26.590><c> while</c><00:11:27.370><c> I</c><00:11:27.400><c> still</c><00:11:27.910><c> had</c><00:11:28.180><c> kind</c><00:11:28.480><c> of</c><00:11:28.540><c> these</c>

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:28.690 align:start position:0%
so while I still had kind of these
 

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
so while I still had kind of these

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.150 align:start position:0%

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
day and run those experiments and so it
 

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.670 align:start position:0%
day and run those experiments and so it
wasn't<00:11:36.610><c> until</c><00:11:36.850><c> the</c><00:11:37.030><c> last</c><00:11:37.180><c> probably</c><00:11:37.780><c> six</c><00:11:38.170><c> to</c>

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't until the last probably six to
 

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.710 align:start position:0%
wasn't until the last probably six to

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
eight months where we started to
 

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.110 align:start position:0%
eight months where we started to

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
experiment a lot more boldly because it
 

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
experiment a lot more boldly because it
was<00:11:43.210><c> quite</c><00:11:43.510><c> it</c><00:11:43.720><c> was</c><00:11:43.810><c> becoming</c><00:11:44.080><c> quite</c><00:11:44.320><c> apparent</c>

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
was quite it was becoming quite apparent
 

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.650 align:start position:0%
was quite it was becoming quite apparent
then<00:11:44.890><c> with</c><00:11:45.100><c> the</c><00:11:45.220><c> scale</c><00:11:45.460><c> that</c><00:11:45.610><c> we</c><00:11:45.730><c> were</c><00:11:45.820><c> at</c><00:11:46.000><c> that</c>

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:46.660 align:start position:0%
then with the scale that we were at that
 

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.210 align:start position:0%
then with the scale that we were at that
that<00:11:46.960><c> vehicle</c><00:11:47.290><c> wasn't</c><00:11:47.860><c> going</c><00:11:48.010><c> to</c><00:11:48.070><c> necessarily</c>

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:48.220 align:start position:0%
that vehicle wasn't going to necessarily
 

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
that vehicle wasn't going to necessarily
work<00:11:48.820><c> and</c><00:11:49.060><c> so</c><00:11:49.600><c> we</c><00:11:49.720><c> started</c><00:11:49.990><c> experiment</c><00:11:50.440><c> with</c>

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:50.530 align:start position:0%
work and so we started experiment with
 

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
work and so we started experiment with
some<00:11:50.680><c> of</c><00:11:50.710><c> these</c><00:11:50.830><c> other</c><00:11:51.040><c> things</c><00:11:51.240><c> but</c><00:11:52.240><c> at</c><00:11:52.450><c> some</c>

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:52.810 align:start position:0%
some of these other things but at some

some of these other things but at some

that's<00:12:03.190><c> when</c><00:12:03.430><c> it</c><00:12:03.550><c> really</c><00:12:03.880><c> I</c><00:12:04.090><c> will</c><00:12:04.360><c> say</c><00:12:04.510><c> that</c>

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:04.660 align:start position:0%
that's when it really I will say that
 

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.450 align:start position:0%
that's when it really I will say that
that<00:12:04.690><c> was</c><00:12:05.080><c> a</c><00:12:05.110><c> forcing</c><00:12:05.590><c> function</c><00:12:05.620><c> of</c><00:12:06.040><c> having</c><00:12:06.370><c> to</c>

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:06.460 align:start position:0%
that was a forcing function of having to
 

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.850 align:start position:0%
that was a forcing function of having to

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:08.860 align:start position:0%
make some important decisions but I will
 

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.490 align:start position:0%
make some important decisions but I will
say<00:12:09.070><c> it</c><00:12:09.190><c> was</c><00:12:09.310><c> always</c><00:12:09.760><c> it</c><00:12:10.660><c> had</c><00:12:10.960><c> been</c><00:12:11.170><c> for</c><00:12:11.350><c> some</c>

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:11.500 align:start position:0%
say it was always it had been for some
 

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.550 align:start position:0%
say it was always it had been for some
time<00:12:12.360><c> consideration</c><00:12:13.360><c> yeah</c><00:12:13.780><c> and</c><00:12:14.230><c> we</c><00:12:14.320><c> can</c><00:12:14.440><c> get</c>

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
time consideration yeah and we can get
 

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.470 align:start position:0%
time consideration yeah and we can get
into<00:12:14.770><c> it</c><00:12:14.860><c> but</c><00:12:14.950><c> it</c><00:12:15.400><c> was</c><00:12:15.550><c> at</c><00:12:15.670><c> that</c><00:12:15.880><c> point</c><00:12:16.240><c> that</c><00:12:16.420><c> I</c>

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
into it but it was at that point that I
 

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
into it but it was at that point that I
was<00:12:16.570><c> like</c><00:12:16.690><c> okay</c><00:12:17.050><c> no</c><00:12:17.200><c> now</c><00:12:17.470><c> we</c><00:12:17.530><c> have</c><00:12:17.740><c> to</c><00:12:17.860><c> really</c>

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.130 align:start position:0%
was like okay no now we have to really

three<00:13:13.780><c> options</c><00:13:14.440><c> one</c><00:13:15.250><c> is</c><00:13:15.820><c> because</c><00:13:16.450><c> we</c><00:13:16.570><c> were</c>

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:16.660 align:start position:0%
three options one is because we were
 

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
three options one is because we were
still<00:13:16.870><c> burning</c><00:13:17.050><c> the</c><00:13:17.500><c> money</c><00:13:17.890><c> that</c><00:13:18.070><c> we</c><00:13:18.160><c> were</c>

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:18.250 align:start position:0%
still burning the money that we were
 

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.190 align:start position:0%
still burning the money that we were
burning<00:13:18.460><c> we</c><00:13:19.120><c> could</c><00:13:19.270><c> pivot</c><00:13:19.480><c> and</c><00:13:19.810><c> I</c><00:13:19.870><c> think</c><00:13:20.020><c> that</c>

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
burning we could pivot and I think that
 

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
burning we could pivot and I think that
so<00:13:20.350><c> hugely</c><00:13:21.510><c> popular</c><00:13:22.510><c> whatever</c><00:13:22.900><c> like</c><00:13:23.170><c> that's</c><00:13:23.680><c> a</c>

but<00:14:08.950><c> it</c><00:14:09.220><c> was</c><00:14:09.430><c> an</c><00:14:09.550><c> option</c><00:14:09.850><c> and</c><00:14:10.000><c> so</c><00:14:10.090><c> I</c><00:14:10.120><c> wanted</c><00:14:10.390><c> to</c>

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.450 align:start position:0%
but it was an option and so I wanted to
 

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
but it was an option and so I wanted to

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.130 align:start position:0%
explore that with folks that I thought
 

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.670 align:start position:0%
explore that with folks that I thought
would<00:14:12.310><c> be</c><00:14:12.370><c> good</c><00:14:12.880><c> partners</c><00:14:13.290><c> that</c><00:14:14.290><c> would</c><00:14:14.410><c> enable</c>

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
would be good partners that would enable
 

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
would be good partners that would enable
us<00:14:14.950><c> to</c><00:14:15.010><c> continue</c><00:14:15.340><c> our</c><00:14:15.730><c> mission</c><00:14:15.910><c> just</c><00:14:16.270><c> in</c><00:14:16.420><c> a</c>

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:16.510 align:start position:0%
us to continue our mission just in a
 

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
us to continue our mission just in a

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:17.710 align:start position:0%
different way with different resources
 

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
different way with different resources
so<00:14:18.220><c> I</c><00:14:18.280><c> thought</c><00:14:18.460><c> that</c><00:14:18.610><c> was</c><00:14:18.760><c> an</c><00:14:18.880><c> admirable</c><00:14:19.180><c> kind</c>

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:19.570 align:start position:0%
so I thought that was an admirable kind
 

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
so I thought that was an admirable kind

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:21.910 align:start position:0%
of option to pursue and then the last
 

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.390 align:start position:0%
of option to pursue and then the last
one<00:14:22.090><c> was</c><00:14:22.240><c> truly</c><00:14:22.630><c> shut</c><00:14:22.990><c> it</c><00:14:23.080><c> down</c><00:14:23.260><c> call</c><00:14:23.950><c> it</c><00:14:24.160><c> and</c>

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
one was truly shut it down call it and
 

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.090 align:start position:0%
one was truly shut it down call it and
do<00:14:24.520><c> all</c><00:14:24.670><c> that</c><00:14:24.700><c> and</c><00:14:25.690><c> so</c><00:14:26.050><c> for</c><00:14:26.260><c> me</c><00:14:26.350><c> I</c><00:14:26.380><c> pursued</c><00:14:26.890><c> all</c>

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:27.100 align:start position:0%
do all that and so for me I pursued all
 

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
do all that and so for me I pursued all
of<00:14:27.220><c> those</c><00:14:27.520><c> I</c><00:14:27.850><c> had</c><00:14:28.480><c> conversations</c><00:14:29.350><c> with</c><00:14:29.470><c> folks</c>

means do one thing and make money and
 

00:41:50.699 --> 00:41:52.399 align:start position:0%

00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.130 align:start position:0%
what the arc of the timeline is but it's
 

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:02.149 align:start position:0%
what the arc of the timeline is but it's

00:42:02.149 --> 00:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
certainly for me I don't look at what we
 

00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
certainly for me I don't look at what we
built<00:42:02.459><c> for</c><00:42:02.699><c> three</c><00:42:02.939><c> and</c><00:42:02.999><c> a</c><00:42:03.059><c> half</c><00:42:03.119><c> years</c><00:42:03.539><c> was</c><00:42:04.109><c> I</c>

00:42:04.839 --> 00:42:04.849 align:start position:0%
built for three and a half years was I
 

00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:07.609 align:start position:0%
built for three and a half years was I
mean<00:42:05.849><c> it</c><00:42:06.179><c> was</c><00:42:06.449><c> meaningful</c><00:42:06.929><c> it</c><00:42:07.169><c> was</c><00:42:07.289><c> valuable</c>

00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
mean it was meaningful it was valuable
 

00:42:07.619 --> 00:42:09.259 align:start position:0%
mean it was meaningful it was valuable
but<00:42:07.890><c> more</c><00:42:08.099><c> than</c><00:42:08.249><c> that</c><00:42:08.309><c> it</c><00:42:08.549><c> was</c><00:42:08.669><c> learning</c><00:42:09.119><c> so</c>

00:42:09.259 --> 00:42:09.269 align:start position:0%
but more than that it was learning so
 

00:42:09.269 --> 00:42:10.669 align:start position:0%
but more than that it was learning so
again<00:42:09.479><c> this</c><00:42:09.599><c> is</c><00:42:09.749><c> like</c><00:42:09.900><c> the</c><00:42:10.289><c> way</c><00:42:10.409><c> that</c><00:42:10.559><c> I</c><00:42:10.589><c> think</c>

00:42:10.669 --> 00:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
again this is like the way that I think
 

00:42:10.679 --> 00:42:12.739 align:start position:0%
again this is like the way that I think

about things almost academically is that
 

00:42:12.749 --> 00:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
about things almost academically is that

00:42:44.519 --> 00:42:44.529 align:start position:0%
hard these ears are yeah and you know
 

00:42:44.529 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
hard these ears are yeah and you know
with<00:42:44.679><c> different</c><00:42:45.009><c> sacrifices</c><00:42:45.309><c> and</c><00:42:45.789><c> things</c>

with different sacrifices and things
 

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:49.769 align:start position:0%
with different sacrifices and things
like<00:42:46.029><c> that</c><00:42:46.089><c> but</c><00:42:46.959><c> for</c><00:42:47.650><c> me</c><00:42:48.309><c> it's</c><00:42:48.640><c> that</c><00:42:48.789><c> if</c><00:42:49.299><c> we</c><00:42:49.630><c> can</c>

00:42:49.769 --> 00:42:49.779 align:start position:0%
like that but for me it's that if we can
 

00:42:49.779 --> 00:42:52.049 align:start position:0%
like that but for me it's that if we can
have<00:42:50.079><c> these</c><00:42:50.349><c> conversations</c><00:42:50.789><c> with</c><00:42:51.789><c> more</c>

00:42:52.049 --> 00:42:52.059 align:start position:0%
have these conversations with more
 

00:42:52.059 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
have these conversations with more

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:54.849 align:start position:0%
fluidity between this like effort and
 

00:42:54.849 --> 00:42:58.709 align:start position:0%
fluidity between this like effort and
like<00:42:54.999><c> the</c><00:42:55.209><c> next</c><00:42:55.749><c> then</c><00:42:56.380><c> maybe</c><00:42:56.849><c> the</c><00:42:57.849><c> hurdle</c>

00:42:58.709 --> 00:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
like the next then maybe the hurdle
 

00:42:58.719 --> 00:43:01.559 align:start position:0%
like the next then maybe the hurdle
between<00:42:59.529><c> one</c><00:42:59.949><c> in</c><00:43:00.069><c> the</c><00:43:00.160><c> next</c><00:43:00.369><c> isn't</c><00:43:00.640><c> quite</c><00:43:01.299><c> so</c>

between one in the next isn't quite so
 

00:43:01.569 --> 00:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
between one in the next isn't quite so
bad<00:43:01.749><c> yeah</c><00:43:01.959><c> I</c><00:43:01.989><c> just</c><00:43:02.169><c> don't</c><00:43:02.469><c> know</c><00:43:02.589><c> why</c><00:43:02.769><c> the</c><00:43:02.829><c> myth</c>

00:43:03.239 --> 00:43:03.249 align:start position:0%
bad yeah I just don't know why the myth
 

00:43:03.249 --> 00:43:05.249 align:start position:0%
bad yeah I just don't know why the myth
is<00:43:03.489><c> so</c><00:43:03.669><c> pervasive</c><00:43:03.910><c> because</c><00:43:04.599><c> like</c><00:43:04.809><c> if</c><00:43:04.989><c> you</c><00:43:05.019><c> look</c>

00:43:28.199 --> 00:43:28.209 align:start position:0%
kind of one way to do this I think the
 

00:43:28.209 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
kind of one way to do this I think the
