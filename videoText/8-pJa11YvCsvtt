00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
um we would be able to focus on a
 

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.310 align:start position:0%
um we would be able to focus on a

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.750 align:start position:0%
product and and that was our strategy
and<00:17:33.520><c> I</c><00:17:33.600><c> think</c><00:17:33.799><c> that</c><00:17:33.960><c> worked</c><00:17:34.240><c> for</c><00:17:34.400><c> us</c><00:17:34.559><c> because</c>

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that worked for us because
 

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.430 align:start position:0%
and I think that worked for us because
we<00:17:34.919><c> really</c><00:17:35.120><c> were</c><00:17:35.360><c> able</c><00:17:35.559><c> to</c><00:17:35.720><c> focus</c><00:17:35.919><c> on</c><00:17:36.039><c> the</c>

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
we really were able to focus on the
 

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.070 align:start position:0%
we really were able to focus on the
product<00:17:37.440><c> so</c><00:17:37.760><c> I</c><00:17:38.000><c> I</c><00:17:38.080><c> think</c><00:17:38.480><c> there's</c><00:17:38.840><c> no</c>

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
