could have heard
 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.070 align:start position:0%
could have heard
it<00:00:23.880><c> we'll</c><00:00:24.080><c> do</c><00:00:24.199><c> our</c><00:00:24.359><c> best</c><00:00:24.560><c> to</c><00:00:24.720><c> try</c><00:00:24.880><c> and</c>

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
it we'll do our best to try and
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.990 align:start position:0%
it we'll do our best to try and
reproduce<00:00:25.599><c> it</c><00:00:26.519><c> um</c><00:00:27.000><c> so</c><00:00:27.240><c> here's</c><00:00:27.480><c> a</c><00:00:27.640><c> question</c>

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
reproduce it um so here's a question
 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.790 align:start position:0%
reproduce it um so here's a question
that<00:00:28.199><c> might</c><00:00:28.359><c> be</c><00:00:28.519><c> a</c><00:00:28.599><c> little</c><00:00:28.760><c> bit</c><00:00:29.320><c> difficult</c><00:00:29.800><c> um</c>

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
that might be a little bit difficult um
 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.389 align:start position:0%
that might be a little bit difficult um
how<00:00:31.080><c> long</c><00:00:31.439><c> before</c><00:00:32.079><c> 2004</c><00:00:32.719><c> could</c><00:00:33.000><c> something</c>

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399 align:start position:0%
how long before 2004 could something
 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.389 align:start position:0%
how long before 2004 could something
like<00:00:33.640><c> Facebook</c><00:00:34.079><c> have</c><00:00:34.280><c> succeeded</c><00:00:35.120><c> like</c><00:00:35.280><c> what</c>

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
like Facebook have succeeded like what
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.869 align:start position:0%
like Facebook have succeeded like what
was<00:00:35.559><c> the</c><00:00:35.800><c> last</c><00:00:36.079><c> thing</c><00:00:36.280><c> that</c><00:00:36.399><c> was</c><00:00:36.520><c> needed</c><00:00:36.800><c> to</c>

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 align:start position:0%
was the last thing that was needed to
 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.670 align:start position:0%
was the last thing that was needed to
fall<00:00:37.120><c> into</c><00:00:37.399><c> place</c><00:00:38.040><c> could</c><00:00:38.200><c> someone</c><00:00:38.440><c> have</c><00:00:38.559><c> done</c>

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
fall into place could someone have done
 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.270 align:start position:0%
fall into place could someone have done
it<00:00:38.800><c> in</c><00:00:39.239><c> 1995</c><00:00:40.239><c> or</c>

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
it in 1995 or
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 align:start position:0%
it in 1995 or
2000<00:00:42.280><c> yeah</c><00:00:42.440><c> no</c><00:00:42.600><c> it's</c><00:00:42.719><c> an</c><00:00:42.840><c> interesting</c>

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
2000 yeah no it's an interesting
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.790 align:start position:0%
2000 yeah no it's an interesting
question<00:00:44.200><c> um</c><00:00:45.200><c> there</c><00:00:45.280><c> were</c><00:00:45.520><c> certain</c><00:00:46.079><c> elements</c>

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
question um there were certain elements
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.189 align:start position:0%
question um there were certain elements
that<00:00:47.559><c> we</c><00:00:48.000><c> certainly</c><00:00:49.000><c> bootstrapped</c><00:00:49.760><c> off</c><00:00:49.920><c> of</c>

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
that we certainly bootstrapped off of
 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.510 align:start position:0%
that we certainly bootstrapped off of
and<00:00:50.399><c> and</c><00:00:50.600><c> kind</c><00:00:50.719><c> of</c><00:00:51.160><c> used</c><00:00:51.520><c> to</c><00:00:51.879><c> hack</c><00:00:52.120><c> early</c>

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
and and kind of used to hack early
 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.549 align:start position:0%
and and kind of used to hack early
identity<00:00:53.120><c> right</c><00:00:53.239><c> so</c><00:00:54.079><c> one</c><00:00:54.160><c> of</c><00:00:54.280><c> the</c><00:00:54.399><c> things</c><00:00:54.719><c> that</c>

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
identity right so one of the things that
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.910 align:start position:0%
identity right so one of the things that
that<00:00:55.840><c> people</c><00:00:56.039><c> don't</c><00:00:56.199><c> think</c><00:00:56.359><c> about</c><00:00:56.559><c> that</c><00:00:56.680><c> often</c>

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 align:start position:0%

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
was like we could just expand so much
 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.629 align:start position:0%
was like we could just expand so much
faster<00:04:41.360><c> um</c><00:04:41.600><c> or</c><00:04:41.759><c> it</c><00:04:41.840><c> would</c><00:04:42.000><c> just</c><00:04:42.080><c> be</c><00:04:42.240><c> easier</c><00:04:42.560><c> I</c>

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 align:start position:0%

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.710 align:start position:0%

mean<00:04:42.800><c> we</c><00:04:42.960><c> we</c><00:04:43.039><c> were</c><00:04:43.160><c> Bound</c><00:04:43.400><c> by</c><00:04:43.520><c> server</c><00:04:43.880><c> capacity</c>

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
mean we we were Bound by server capacity
 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.270 align:start position:0%
mean we we were Bound by server capacity

and<00:08:32.680><c> I</c><00:08:32.760><c> think</c><00:08:32.880><c> it</c><00:08:33.039><c> is</c><00:08:33.360><c> but</c><00:08:34.240><c> it</c><00:08:34.440><c> it</c><00:08:34.680><c> wasn't</c><00:08:35.039><c> as</c>

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
and I think it is but it it wasn't as
 

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.550 align:start position:0%
and I think it is but it it wasn't as

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.310 align:start position:0%
quick as a lot of things grow today and
I<00:08:36.640><c> think</c><00:08:36.800><c> actually</c><00:08:37.080><c> having</c><00:08:37.360><c> that</c><00:08:37.680><c> time</c><00:08:38.159><c> to</c>

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
I think actually having that time to
 

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.870 align:start position:0%
I think actually having that time to
bake<00:08:38.560><c> it</c><00:08:38.760><c> was</c><00:08:38.919><c> really</c><00:08:39.200><c> valuable</c><00:08:39.519><c> for</c><00:08:39.640><c> us</c><00:08:39.800><c> and</c>

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
bake it was really valuable for us and
 

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.709 align:start position:0%

there<00:08:39.959><c> were</c><00:08:40.080><c> like</c><00:08:40.240><c> 2,000</c><00:08:40.719><c> users</c><00:08:41.039><c> at</c>

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:51.470 align:start position:0%
4,000 or 5,000 undergrads at Harvard I I
remember<00:08:50.200><c> reading</c><00:08:50.480><c> you</c><00:08:50.600><c> got</c><00:08:50.800><c> half</c><00:08:50.959><c> of</c><00:08:51.120><c> them</c><00:08:51.399><c> I</c>

remember reading you got half of them I
 

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.790 align:start position:0%
remember reading you got half of them I
mean<00:08:51.720><c> presumably</c><00:08:52.080><c> you</c><00:08:52.480><c> no</c><00:08:52.760><c> there</c><00:08:52.959><c> was</c><00:08:53.120><c> 23s</c><00:08:53.680><c> or</c>

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
mean presumably you no there was 23s or
 

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.550 align:start position:0%
mean presumably you no there was 23s or
3/4<00:08:54.360><c> or</c><00:08:54.440><c> something</c><00:08:54.640><c> in</c><00:08:54.760><c> the</c><00:08:54.880><c> first</c><00:08:55.040><c> two</c><00:08:55.240><c> weeks</c>

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.910 align:start position:0%
3/4 or something in the first two weeks
so<00:08:55.720><c> I</c><00:08:55.760><c> mean</c><00:08:55.880><c> the</c><00:08:55.959><c> thing</c><00:08:56.080><c> that</c><00:08:56.200><c> we</c><00:08:56.360><c> found</c><00:08:56.680><c> was</c>

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
so I mean the thing that we found was
 

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.190 align:start position:0%
so I mean the thing that we found was
that<00:08:57.480><c> basically</c><00:08:58.399><c> we'd</c><00:08:58.600><c> open</c><00:08:58.760><c> it</c><00:08:58.880><c> up</c><00:08:59.000><c> at</c><00:08:59.079><c> a</c>

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
that basically we'd open it up at a
 

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.310 align:start position:0%
that basically we'd open it up at a
school<00:08:59.440><c> schol</c><00:09:00.200><c> and</c><00:09:00.480><c> um</c><00:09:00.640><c> and</c><00:09:00.839><c> within</c><00:09:01.120><c> you</c><00:09:01.200><c> know</c>

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
school schol and um and within you know
 

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.470 align:start position:0%
school schol and um and within you know
a<00:09:01.440><c> couple</c><00:09:01.600><c> of</c><00:09:01.760><c> weeks</c><00:09:02.160><c> then</c><00:09:02.800><c> the</c><00:09:02.959><c> vast</c><00:09:03.200><c> majority</c>

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks then the vast majority
 

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.590 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks then the vast majority

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
way um we can go back for spring
 

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:02.110 align:start position:0%
way um we can go back for spring
semester<00:31:00.679><c> and</c><00:31:00.799><c> run</c><00:31:01.000><c> it</c><00:31:01.120><c> more</c><00:31:01.320><c> autonomously</c>

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
semester and run it more autonomously
 

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.310 align:start position:0%
semester and run it more autonomously
and<00:31:02.279><c> and</c><00:31:02.360><c> it'll</c><00:31:02.600><c> grow</c><00:31:02.840><c> and</c><00:31:02.919><c> we'll</c><00:31:03.080><c> be</c><00:31:03.159><c> able</c><00:31:03.279><c> to</c>

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
run it more autonomously so we did that
 

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.430 align:start position:0%
run it more autonomously so we did that
um<00:31:06.320><c> and</c><00:31:06.600><c> and</c><00:31:06.720><c> of</c><00:31:06.799><c> course</c><00:31:06.919><c> we</c><00:31:07.039><c> raised</c><00:31:07.279><c> money</c>

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.990 align:start position:0%
before I did um but um but so then you
know<00:31:26.080><c> spring</c><00:31:26.399><c> term</c><00:31:26.840><c> came</c><00:31:27.039><c> along</c><00:31:27.399><c> and</c><00:31:27.679><c> you</c><00:31:27.799><c> know</c>

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
know spring term came along and you know
 

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.310 align:start position:0%
know spring term came along and you know
we<00:31:28.080><c> hadn't</c><00:31:28.279><c> quite</c><00:31:28.480><c> built</c><00:31:28.679><c> the</c><00:31:28.840><c> tooling</c><00:31:29.159><c> and</c>

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
we hadn't quite built the tooling and
 

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.029 align:start position:0%
we hadn't quite built the tooling and
automation<00:31:30.039><c> so</c><00:31:30.480><c> you</c><00:31:30.600><c> know</c><00:31:30.720><c> let's</c><00:31:30.880><c> take</c>

00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
automation so you know let's take
 

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:32.509 align:start position:0%
automation so you know let's take
another<00:31:31.279><c> term</c><00:31:31.559><c> off</c><00:31:31.799><c> and</c><00:31:31.919><c> then</c><00:31:32.080><c> finally</c><00:31:32.399><c> at</c>

00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
another term off and then finally at
 

00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:34.310 align:start position:0%
another term off and then finally at
some<00:31:32.720><c> point</c><00:31:33.039><c> we</c><00:31:33.480><c> we</c><00:31:33.600><c> just</c><00:31:33.720><c> figured</c><00:31:34.080><c> that</c><00:31:34.200><c> we</c>

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
some point we we just figured that we
 

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.029 align:start position:0%
some point we we just figured that we

00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
were that we were out there but by then
 

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:38.430 align:start position:0%
were that we were out there but by then
I<00:31:36.080><c> mean</c><00:31:36.240><c> we</c><00:31:36.440><c> had</c><00:31:37.000><c> you</c><00:31:37.120><c> know</c><00:31:37.320><c> millions</c><00:31:37.760><c> of</c><00:31:38.120><c> of</c><00:31:38.320><c> of</c>
