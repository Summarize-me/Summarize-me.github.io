00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:55.100 align:start position:0%
problem finding mechanism yeah you know
 

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.530 align:start position:0%
problem finding mechanism yeah you know
yeah<00:18:56.100><c> I</c><00:18:56.520><c> mean</c><00:18:56.580><c> it</c><00:18:56.880><c> was</c><00:18:56.940><c> yeah</c><00:18:57.210><c> because</c><00:18:57.330><c> it</c><00:18:57.510><c> was</c>
