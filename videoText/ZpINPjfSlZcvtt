00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.009 align:start position:0%
this this mobile device revolution and
we<00:00:59.879><c> thought</c><00:01:00.120><c> why</c><00:01:00.269><c> wouldn't</c><00:01:00.600><c> it</c><00:01:00.660><c> be</c><00:01:00.780><c> great</c><00:01:00.960><c> if</c>

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.189 align:start position:0%
we thought why wouldn't it be great if
you<00:01:01.320><c> could</c><00:01:01.530><c> talk</c><00:01:01.679><c> to</c><00:01:01.859><c> your</c><00:01:01.949><c> phone</c><00:01:02.190><c> um</c><00:01:02.609><c> and</c><00:01:03.570><c> that</c>

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 align:start position:0%
would sort of transform the user
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.820 align:start position:0%
would sort of transform the user
interface<00:01:06.180><c> experience</c><00:01:06.750><c> and</c><00:01:06.900><c> all</c><00:01:06.990><c> that</c><00:01:07.260><c> and</c><00:01:07.710><c> so</c>

we<00:01:22.410><c> said</c><00:01:22.590><c> okay</c><00:01:22.800><c> voice</c><00:01:23.040><c> would</c><00:01:23.250><c> be</c><00:01:23.340><c> the</c><00:01:23.460><c> great</c>

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
we said okay voice would be the great

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
so we were kind of in the d.school so we
 

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.670 align:start position:0%
so we were kind of in the d.school so we

other stuff sort of you got to figure it
out<00:20:52.570><c> it's</c><00:20:52.779><c> not</c><00:20:52.899><c> easy</c><00:20:53.139><c> but</c><00:20:54.010><c> that's</c><00:20:54.250><c> the</c><00:20:54.519><c> core</c>

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:54.850 align:start position:0%
out it's not easy but that's the core
 

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
out it's not easy but that's the core
thing<00:20:54.880><c> right</c><00:20:55.830><c> and</c><00:20:56.830><c> if</c><00:20:56.950><c> you</c><00:20:57.039><c> don't</c><00:20:57.220><c> do</c><00:20:57.460><c> it</c>

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:57.490 align:start position:0%
thing right and if you don't do it
 

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
thing right and if you don't do it
everything<00:20:57.760><c> gets</c><00:20:58.029><c> really</c><00:20:58.269><c> bad</c><00:20:58.419><c> and</c><00:20:58.809><c> if</c><00:20:59.409><c> you</c><00:20:59.500><c> do</c>

00:20:59.700 --> 00:20:59.710 align:start position:0%
everything gets really bad and if you do
 

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.169 align:start position:0%
everything gets really bad and if you do
then<00:20:59.889><c> you</c><00:21:00.010><c> can</c><00:21:00.039><c> build</c><00:21:00.370><c> from</c><00:21:00.519><c> there</c><00:21:00.760><c> and</c><00:21:01.000><c> things</c>

00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:01.179 align:start position:0%
then you can build from there and things
 

00:21:01.179 --> 00:21:03.210 align:start position:0%
then you can build from there and things

but<00:27:39.640><c> then</c><00:27:39.760><c> we</c><00:27:39.820><c> got</c><00:27:39.940><c> the</c><00:27:40.090><c> speed</c><00:27:40.450><c> at</c><00:27:40.630><c> which</c><00:27:40.660><c> the</c>

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
but then we got the speed at which the
 

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
but then we got the speed at which the

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:42.910 align:start position:0%
software guys could iterate to sort of
 

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.670 align:start position:0%
software guys could iterate to sort of

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
infuse our hardware team and so they
 

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
infuse our hardware team and so they
kind<00:27:44.860><c> of</c><00:27:44.890><c> tried</c><00:27:45.040><c> to</c><00:27:45.130><c> get</c><00:27:45.760><c> what</c><00:27:45.940><c> the</c><00:27:46.030><c> best</c><00:27:46.210><c> of</c>

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:46.450 align:start position:0%
kind of tried to get what the best of

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:48.730 align:start position:0%
each of these things were and then

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.230 align:start position:0%
