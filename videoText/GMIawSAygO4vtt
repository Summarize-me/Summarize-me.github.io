00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
love with Cisco or Oracle you know and
 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.210 align:start position:0%
love with Cisco or Oracle you know and
and<00:06:14.520><c> that</c><00:06:14.820><c> makes</c><00:06:14.940><c> sense</c><00:06:15.180><c> exactly</c>

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense exactly
 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.969 align:start position:0%
and that makes sense exactly
and<00:06:17.820><c> and</c><00:06:18.060><c> so</c><00:06:18.300><c> I</c><00:06:18.660><c> think</c><00:06:18.780><c> we</c><00:06:19.020><c> get</c><00:06:19.259><c> told</c><00:06:19.620><c> these</c>

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 align:start position:0%

and and so I think we get told these

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 align:start position:0%

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.469 align:start position:0%

um

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
and this is rough why is this rough
 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.610 align:start position:0%
and this is rough why is this rough

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
Michael why is why is it hard
 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.890 align:start position:0%
Michael why is why is it hard
doing<00:06:40.979><c> consumer</c><00:06:41.639><c> stuff</c><00:06:41.880><c> so</c><00:06:42.240><c> I</c><00:06:42.360><c> think</c><00:06:42.479><c> there's</c>

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
doing consumer stuff so I think there's
 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.650 align:start position:0%
doing consumer stuff so I think there's
two<00:06:43.500><c> challenges</c><00:06:44.039><c> here</c><00:06:44.400><c> I</c><00:06:44.819><c> think</c><00:06:45.000><c> the</c><00:06:45.419><c> first</c>

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
two challenges here I think the first
 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.450 align:start position:0%
two challenges here I think the first
challenge<00:06:46.020><c> is</c><00:06:46.319><c> people</c><00:06:46.740><c> often</c><00:06:47.340><c> don't</c>

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
challenge is people often don't
 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.330 align:start position:0%
challenge is people often don't
understand<00:06:47.699><c> how</c><00:06:48.240><c> high</c><00:06:48.479><c> the</c><00:06:48.720><c> bar</c><00:06:48.960><c> is</c>

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
understand how high the bar is
 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.610 align:start position:0%
understand how high the bar is
the<00:06:51.060><c> consumer</c><00:06:51.539><c> products</c><00:06:51.900><c> that</c><00:06:52.020><c> they</c><00:06:52.139><c> use</c><00:06:52.259><c> they</c>

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
the consumer products that they use they
 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.890 align:start position:0%
the consumer products that they use they
don't<00:06:52.740><c> realize</c><00:06:53.280><c> how</c><00:06:53.819><c> actually</c><00:06:54.060><c> good</c><00:06:54.419><c> they</c><00:06:54.720><c> are</c>

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
don't realize how actually good they are
 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.950 align:start position:0%
don't realize how actually good they are
and<00:06:55.620><c> how</c><00:06:55.860><c> many</c><00:06:56.039><c> others</c><00:06:56.639><c> existed</c><00:06:57.300><c> and</c><00:06:57.539><c> failed</c>

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
and how many others existed and failed
 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.110 align:start position:0%
and how many others existed and failed
so<00:06:58.319><c> that's</c><00:06:58.440><c> the</c><00:06:58.740><c> first</c><00:06:58.919><c> thing</c><00:06:59.160><c> and</c><00:06:59.880><c> I</c><00:07:00.000><c> think</c>

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing and I think
 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.909 align:start position:0%
so that's the first thing and I think
the<00:07:00.300><c> second</c><00:07:00.479><c> thing</c><00:07:00.660><c> and</c><00:07:01.020><c> we</c><00:07:01.560><c> should</c><00:07:01.680><c> get</c><00:07:01.800><c> into</c>

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
the second thing and we should get into
 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:03.170 align:start position:0%
the second thing and we should get into
this<00:07:02.100><c> a</c><00:07:02.160><c> little</c><00:07:02.220><c> bit</c><00:07:02.340><c> more</c><00:07:02.460><c> is</c><00:07:02.639><c> that</c><00:07:02.759><c> I</c><00:07:03.060><c> think</c>

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more is that I think
 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.469 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more is that I think
that<00:07:03.620><c> timing</c><00:07:04.620><c> tends</c><00:07:05.100><c> to</c><00:07:05.160><c> be</c><00:07:05.340><c> very</c><00:07:05.819><c> important</c>

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
that timing tends to be very important
 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
that timing tends to be very important
in<00:07:06.960><c> consumer</c><00:07:07.580><c> so</c><00:07:08.580><c> I</c><00:07:09.000><c> think</c><00:07:09.120><c> sometimes</c><00:07:09.600><c> people</c>

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
in consumer so I think sometimes people
 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.650 align:start position:0%
in consumer so I think sometimes people
don't<00:07:10.199><c> realize</c>

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
don't realize
 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.689 align:start position:0%
don't realize

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
um when timing is helping them in a

um when timing is helping them in a

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
consumer business and when timing is
 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.450 align:start position:0%
consumer business and when timing is
actually<00:07:16.199><c> harming</c><00:07:16.680><c> them</c><00:07:16.800><c> and</c><00:07:17.100><c> existing</c>

the the challenge is is like that's a

like yeah how do you dig a Little Deeper
you<00:21:07.080><c> want</c><00:21:07.200><c> to</c><00:21:07.320><c> put</c><00:21:07.380><c> that</c><00:21:07.500><c> into</c><00:21:07.679><c> practice</c><00:21:07.980><c> and</c>

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
you want to put that into practice and
 

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.789 align:start position:0%
you want to put that into practice and
ideally<00:21:09.179><c> you</c><00:21:09.360><c> want</c><00:21:09.600><c> to</c><00:21:09.780><c> ideally</c><00:21:10.500><c> you</c><00:21:10.679><c> have</c>

ideally you want to ideally you have
something<00:21:10.980><c> deeper</c><00:21:11.340><c> then</c><00:21:11.460><c> and</c><00:21:11.820><c> so</c><00:21:11.940><c> therefore</c>

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
something deeper then and so therefore
 

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.029 align:start position:0%
something deeper then and so therefore
we're<00:21:12.419><c> going</c><00:21:12.539><c> to</c><00:21:12.660><c> add</c><00:21:12.780><c> tokens</c><00:21:13.200><c> or</c><00:21:13.620><c> therefore</c>

00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to add tokens or therefore
 

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.549 align:start position:0%
we're going to add tokens or therefore
something<00:21:14.400><c> something</c><00:21:14.820><c> nfts</c><00:21:15.660><c> like</c><00:21:16.080><c> the</c><00:21:16.200><c> bar</c><00:21:16.380><c> is</c>

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
describing what makes a great pivot is
 

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.090 align:start position:0%

these vectors well and this might be

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is
 

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.990 align:start position:0%
what we're saying is
