00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:22.780 align:start position:0%
the transaction it took us time to learn
 

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
the transaction it took us time to learn
that<00:27:22.810><c> all</c><00:27:23.260><c> right</c><00:27:23.560><c> so</c><00:27:23.800><c> I</c><00:27:24.490><c> mean</c><00:27:24.880><c> even</c><00:27:25.240><c> like</c><00:27:25.390><c> her</c>

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:25.510 align:start position:0%
that all right so I mean even like her
 

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
that all right so I mean even like her
fees<00:27:25.900><c> was</c><00:27:26.290><c> just</c><00:27:26.500><c> so</c><00:27:26.740><c> low</c><00:27:27.100><c> we</c><00:27:27.490><c> were</c><00:27:27.610><c> charging</c><00:27:28.000><c> I</c>

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.390 align:start position:0%
fees was just so low we were charging I
 

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.340 align:start position:0%
fees was just so low we were charging I
think<00:27:29.350><c> it</c><00:27:29.440><c> was</c><00:27:29.530><c> like</c><00:27:29.620><c> ten</c><00:27:29.950><c> to</c><00:27:30.190><c> fifteen</c><00:27:30.520><c> percent</c>

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:31.350 align:start position:0%
think it was like ten to fifteen percent
 

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.690 align:start position:0%
think it was like ten to fifteen percent
transaction<00:27:32.350><c> fee</c><00:27:32.710><c> versus</c><00:27:33.190><c> now</c><00:27:33.340><c> it's</c><00:27:33.520><c> like</c>

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:33.700 align:start position:0%
transaction fee versus now it's like
 

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.370 align:start position:0%
transaction fee versus now it's like
nineteen<00:27:34.270><c> to</c><00:27:34.450><c> twenty</c><00:27:34.480><c> nine</c><00:27:34.720><c> percent</c>

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:35.380 align:start position:0%
nineteen to twenty nine percent
 

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
nineteen to twenty nine percent
yeah<00:27:35.640><c> and</c><00:27:36.640><c> that's</c><00:27:37.030><c> because</c><00:27:37.360><c> we</c><00:27:37.480><c> were</c><00:27:37.570><c> not</c>

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:37.690 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's because we were not
 

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's because we were not

kind of the foundation and structure but
 

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.790 align:start position:0%
kind of the foundation and structure but

for sure it's gonna change and once you
 

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.710 align:start position:0%
for sure it's gonna change and once you

work with the moving company we just
 

00:29:22.179 --> 00:29:23.909 align:start position:0%

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:27.580 align:start position:0%
negotiate yeah and then it definitely
 

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.389 align:start position:0%
negotiate yeah and then it definitely
did<00:29:27.700><c> not</c><00:29:27.730><c> work</c><00:29:28.119><c> out</c><00:29:28.330><c> because</c><00:29:29.259><c> you</c><00:29:29.889><c> know</c><00:29:30.039><c> they</c>

00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
did not work out because you know they
 

00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:32.190 align:start position:0%
did not work out because you know they
ended<00:29:31.059><c> up</c><00:29:31.179><c> canceling</c><00:29:31.389><c> a</c><00:29:31.629><c> lot</c><00:29:31.749><c> of</c><00:29:31.840><c> our</c><00:29:31.960><c> jobs</c>

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
ended up canceling a lot of our jobs
 

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
ended up canceling a lot of our jobs
because<00:29:32.409><c> they</c><00:29:32.679><c> get</c><00:29:32.799><c> more</c><00:29:32.950><c> expensive</c><00:29:33.190><c> jobs</c><00:29:33.609><c> and</c>

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:33.970 align:start position:0%
because they get more expensive jobs and
 

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
because they get more expensive jobs and
our<00:29:34.779><c> customers</c><00:29:35.139><c> were</c><00:29:35.230><c> getting</c><00:29:35.470><c> upset</c><00:29:35.799><c> so</c><00:29:36.220><c> then</c>

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:36.369 align:start position:0%
our customers were getting upset so then
 

00:29:36.369 --> 00:29:38.149 align:start position:0%
our customers were getting upset so then
we<00:29:36.580><c> brought</c><00:29:36.820><c> it</c><00:29:36.999><c> in-house</c><00:29:37.330><c> and</c><00:29:37.359><c> we</c><00:29:37.690><c> were</c><00:29:37.869><c> just</c>

00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
we brought it in-house and we were just
 

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:40.379 align:start position:0%
we brought it in-house and we were just
we<00:29:39.159><c> probably</c><00:29:39.460><c> kept</c><00:29:39.850><c> it</c><00:29:39.970><c> at</c><00:29:40.029><c> the</c><00:29:40.149><c> same</c><00:29:40.330><c> price</c>

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:40.389 align:start position:0%
we probably kept it at the same price
 

00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:43.259 align:start position:0%
we probably kept it at the same price
initially<00:29:41.109><c> yeah</c><00:29:41.739><c> and</c><00:29:42.309><c> I</c><00:29:42.369><c> definitely</c><00:29:42.730><c> at</c><00:29:43.119><c> that</c>

00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:43.269 align:start position:0%
initially yeah and I definitely at that
 

00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
initially yeah and I definitely at that
point<00:29:43.509><c> was</c><00:29:43.690><c> negative</c><00:29:44.109><c> margins</c><00:29:44.940><c> then</c><00:29:45.940><c> we</c>

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:46.809 align:start position:0%
point was negative margins then we
 

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:49.619 align:start position:0%
point was negative margins then we
actually<00:29:47.289><c> ran</c><00:29:47.769><c> a</c><00:29:48.070><c> be</c><00:29:48.220><c> testing</c><00:29:48.639><c> in</c><00:29:48.999><c> terms</c><00:29:49.480><c> of</c>

00:29:49.619 --> 00:29:49.629 align:start position:0%
actually ran a be testing in terms of
 

00:29:49.629 --> 00:29:52.229 align:start position:0%
actually ran a be testing in terms of
pricing<00:29:49.929><c> to</c><00:29:50.379><c> understand</c><00:29:51.039><c> prices</c><00:29:51.460><c> sensitivity</c>

00:29:52.229 --> 00:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
pricing to understand prices sensitivity
 

00:29:52.239 --> 00:29:54.509 align:start position:0%
pricing to understand prices sensitivity
and<00:29:52.419><c> that</c><00:29:53.080><c> helped</c><00:29:53.470><c> us</c><00:29:53.590><c> determine</c><00:29:53.919><c> like</c><00:29:54.249><c> what</c>

00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:54.519 align:start position:0%
and that helped us determine like what
 

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:56.909 align:start position:0%
and that helped us determine like what
is<00:29:54.669><c> the</c><00:29:54.850><c> reader</c><00:29:55.629><c> to</c><00:29:55.779><c> threshold</c><00:29:56.109><c> for</c><00:29:56.710><c> what</c>

00:29:56.909 --> 00:29:56.919 align:start position:0%
is the reader to threshold for what
 

00:29:56.919 --> 00:29:58.950 align:start position:0%
is the reader to threshold for what
people<00:29:57.220><c> are</c><00:29:57.309><c> willing</c><00:29:57.460><c> to</c><00:29:57.759><c> pay</c><00:29:57.940><c> versus</c><00:29:58.509><c> it's</c>

00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
people are willing to pay versus it's
 

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.749 align:start position:0%
people are willing to pay versus it's
kind<00:29:59.109><c> of</c><00:29:59.139><c> like</c><00:29:59.289><c> a</c><00:29:59.320><c> formula</c><00:29:59.889><c> you</c><00:30:00.279><c> can</c><00:30:00.429><c> sell</c><00:30:00.639><c> more</c>

00:30:00.749 --> 00:30:00.759 align:start position:0%
kind of like a formula you can sell more
 

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:04.049 align:start position:0%
kind of like a formula you can sell more
products<00:30:01.299><c> mmm</c><00:30:01.840><c> and</c><00:30:02.070><c> lower</c><00:30:03.070><c> delivery</c><00:30:03.609><c> fees</c><00:30:03.820><c> and</c>

00:30:04.049 --> 00:30:04.059 align:start position:0%
products mmm and lower delivery fees and
 

00:30:04.059 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
products mmm and lower delivery fees and
maybe<00:30:04.239><c> your</c><00:30:04.450><c> fees</c><00:30:04.749><c> will</c><00:30:05.019><c> cover</c><00:30:05.259><c> the</c>

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:05.590 align:start position:0%
maybe your fees will cover the
 

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.950 align:start position:0%
maybe your fees will cover the
difference<00:30:06.429><c> yeah</c><00:30:06.850><c> or</c><00:30:06.999><c> you</c><00:30:07.570><c> sell</c><00:30:07.779><c> less</c>

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
difference yeah or you sell less
 

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.749 align:start position:0%
difference yeah or you sell less
products<00:30:08.379><c> and</c><00:30:08.499><c> higher</c><00:30:08.769><c> delivery</c><00:30:09.249><c> fees</c><00:30:09.429><c> right</c>

00:30:09.749 --> 00:30:09.759 align:start position:0%
products and higher delivery fees right
 

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:11.609 align:start position:0%
products and higher delivery fees right
and<00:30:09.970><c> so</c><00:30:10.090><c> like</c><00:30:10.299><c> we</c><00:30:10.509><c> fear</c><00:30:10.720><c> we</c><00:30:10.960><c> finally</c>

00:30:11.609 --> 00:30:11.619 align:start position:0%
and so like we fear we finally
 

00:30:11.619 --> 00:30:14.549 align:start position:0%
and so like we fear we finally
understand<00:30:12.609><c> what</c><00:30:12.879><c> is</c><00:30:12.999><c> the</c><00:30:13.149><c> right</c><00:30:13.389><c> mix</c><00:30:13.840><c> yeah</c><00:30:14.320><c> to</c>

00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
understand what is the right mix yeah to
 

00:30:14.559 --> 00:30:16.349 align:start position:0%
understand what is the right mix yeah to
make<00:30:14.649><c> it</c><00:30:14.830><c> work</c><00:30:15.009><c> and</c><00:30:15.580><c> do</c><00:30:15.669><c> you</c><00:30:15.759><c> think</c><00:30:15.940><c> that</c><00:30:16.059><c> sweet</c>

00:30:16.349 --> 00:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
make it work and do you think that sweet
 

00:30:16.359 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
make it work and do you think that sweet
spot<00:30:16.659><c> is</c><00:30:16.779><c> the</c><00:30:16.899><c> same</c><00:30:17.200><c> across</c><00:30:17.619><c> cities</c><00:30:18.809><c> no</c><00:30:19.809><c> I</c>

00:30:20.159 --> 00:30:20.169 align:start position:0%
spot is the same across cities no I
 

00:30:20.169 --> 00:30:23.450 align:start position:0%
spot is the same across cities no I
don't<00:30:20.409><c> think</c><00:30:20.499><c> it</c><00:30:20.739><c> would</c><00:30:20.889><c> be</c><00:30:20.919><c> the</c><00:30:21.159><c> same</c><00:30:21.509><c> but</c>

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be the same but
 

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.849 align:start position:0%
don't think it would be the same but
they'll<00:30:24.460><c> have</c><00:30:24.609><c> to</c><00:30:24.730><c> wait</c><00:30:24.850><c> in</c><00:30:24.999><c> yes</c><00:30:25.749><c> see</c><00:30:26.169><c> yes</c><00:30:26.590><c> you</c>

00:30:26.849 --> 00:30:26.859 align:start position:0%
they'll have to wait in yes see yes you
 

00:30:26.859 --> 00:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
they'll have to wait in yes see yes you
read<00:30:27.039><c> it</c><00:30:27.129><c> yeah</c><00:30:27.399><c> TPD</c><00:30:27.730><c> bad</c><00:30:28.059><c> New</c><00:30:28.330><c> York</c><00:30:28.509><c> is</c><00:30:28.690><c> I</c><00:30:28.960><c> think</c>

00:30:29.639 --> 00:30:29.649 align:start position:0%
read it yeah TPD bad New York is I think
 

00:30:29.649 --> 00:30:31.619 align:start position:0%
read it yeah TPD bad New York is I think
I<00:30:30.009><c> think</c><00:30:30.369><c> in</c><00:30:30.460><c> New</c><00:30:30.609><c> York</c><00:30:30.879><c> because</c><00:30:31.179><c> people</c><00:30:31.450><c> don't</c>

00:30:31.619 --> 00:30:31.629 align:start position:0%
I think in New York because people don't
 

00:30:31.629 --> 00:30:35.549 align:start position:0%
I think in New York because people don't
have<00:30:31.749><c> cars</c><00:30:32.399><c> yeah</c><00:30:33.399><c> um</c><00:30:33.669><c> it's</c><00:30:33.999><c> much</c><00:30:34.269><c> harder</c><00:30:34.559><c> right</c>

00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
have cars yeah um it's much harder right
 

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:36.810 align:start position:0%
have cars yeah um it's much harder right
and<00:30:35.769><c> so</c><00:30:35.889><c> people</c><00:30:36.070><c> are</c><00:30:36.190><c> probably</c><00:30:36.340><c> willing</c><00:30:36.700><c> to</c>

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:36.820 align:start position:0%
and so people are probably willing to
 

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.210 align:start position:0%
and so people are probably willing to
pay<00:30:36.999><c> I</c><00:30:37.269><c> would</c><00:30:37.570><c> venture</c><00:30:37.899><c> to</c><00:30:38.080><c> guess</c><00:30:38.200><c> a</c><00:30:38.559><c> bit</c><00:30:38.859><c> more</c>

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:39.220 align:start position:0%
pay I would venture to guess a bit more
 

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
pay I would venture to guess a bit more
for<00:30:39.789><c> delivery</c><00:30:40.239><c> than</c><00:30:40.509><c> in</c><00:30:40.659><c> other</c><00:30:40.840><c> cities</c><00:30:41.139><c> and</c>

that was quite a lesson learned and I

team of engineers so so I I knew how to
do<00:41:32.450><c> that</c><00:41:32.570><c> part</c><00:41:32.860><c> yeah</c><00:41:33.860><c> yeah</c><00:41:34.160><c> that</c><00:41:34.520><c> was</c><00:41:34.610><c> possible</c>

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.150 align:start position:0%
do that part yeah yeah that was possible
 

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.900 align:start position:0%
do that part yeah yeah that was possible
yeah<00:41:35.240><c> all</c><00:41:35.360><c> right</c><00:41:35.510><c> and</c><00:41:35.690><c> then</c><00:41:36.590><c> what</c><00:41:36.770><c> about</c><00:41:36.910><c> the</c>

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:37.910 align:start position:0%
yeah all right and then what about the
 

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:40.570 align:start position:0%
yeah all right and then what about the
the<00:41:38.180><c> choice</c><00:41:38.480><c> to</c><00:41:38.510><c> actually</c><00:41:39.320><c> not</c><00:41:39.740><c> warehouse</c><00:41:40.250><c> was</c>

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:40.580 align:start position:0%
the choice to actually not warehouse was
 

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.550 align:start position:0%
the choice to actually not warehouse was
that<00:41:40.760><c> obvious</c><00:41:41.300><c> from</c><00:41:41.540><c> the</c><00:41:41.660><c> beginning</c><00:41:42.020><c> it</c><00:41:42.500><c> was</c>

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
that obvious from the beginning it was
 

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.230 align:start position:0%
that obvious from the beginning it was
that<00:41:42.920><c> was</c><00:41:43.040><c> always</c><00:41:43.250><c> the</c><00:41:43.430><c> plan</c><00:41:43.610><c> we</c><00:41:43.880><c> never</c>

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
that was always the plan we never
 

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.770 align:start position:0%
that was always the plan we never
considered<00:41:44.750><c> warehousing</c><00:41:45.050><c> certain</c><00:41:45.800><c> it</c><00:41:46.430><c> was</c>

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:46.780 align:start position:0%
considered warehousing certain it was
 

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
considered warehousing certain it was
warehousing<00:41:47.780><c> was</c><00:41:47.930><c> not</c><00:41:48.200><c> the</c><00:41:48.410><c> obvious</c><00:41:48.740><c> solution</c>

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:48.890 align:start position:0%
warehousing was not the obvious solution
 

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:52.410 align:start position:0%
warehousing was not the obvious solution
for<00:41:49.310><c> us</c><00:41:49.460><c> because</c><00:41:49.670><c> we</c><00:41:50.000><c> we</c><00:41:50.360><c> always</c><00:41:50.510><c> thought</c><00:41:50.870><c> that</c>

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:52.420 align:start position:0%
for us because we we always thought that
 

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.890 align:start position:0%
for us because we we always thought that
you're<00:41:53.420><c> gonna</c><00:41:53.600><c> be</c><00:41:53.780><c> capped</c><00:41:54.110><c> by</c><00:41:54.380><c> this</c>

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
you're gonna be capped by this
 

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:59.210 align:start position:0%
you're gonna be capped by this
space<00:41:55.320><c> of</c><00:41:55.620><c> it</c><00:41:55.800><c> exactly</c><00:41:56.810><c> uh</c><00:41:57.810><c> you</c><00:41:58.500><c> know</c><00:41:58.650><c> it's</c>

00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
space of it exactly uh you know it's
 

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.410 align:start position:0%
space of it exactly uh you know it's
kind<00:41:59.250><c> of</c><00:41:59.400><c> like</c><00:41:59.580><c> like</c><00:42:00.360><c> if</c><00:42:00.570><c> you</c><00:42:00.720><c> use</c><00:42:00.870><c> the</c><00:42:01.050><c> air</c><00:42:01.290><c> B&amp;B</c>

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:02.420 align:start position:0%
kind of like like if you use the air B&amp;B
 

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.150 align:start position:0%
kind of like like if you use the air B&amp;B
example<00:42:03.420><c> like</c><00:42:03.690><c> building</c><00:42:04.170><c> hotels</c><00:42:04.380><c> versus</c>

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
example like building hotels versus
 

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.070 align:start position:0%
example like building hotels versus
making<00:42:05.430><c> everybody's</c><00:42:06.060><c> apartment</c><00:42:06.690><c> a</c><00:42:06.750><c> hotel</c>

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
making everybody's apartment a hotel
 

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
making everybody's apartment a hotel
yeah<00:42:07.530><c> and</c><00:42:07.740><c> so</c><00:42:08.040><c> you</c><00:42:08.370><c> know</c><00:42:08.490><c> we</c><00:42:08.730><c> always</c><00:42:09.380><c> not</c><00:42:10.380><c> that</c>

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:10.530 align:start position:0%
yeah and so you know we always not that
 

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:11.990 align:start position:0%
yeah and so you know we always not that
we<00:42:10.650><c> knew</c><00:42:10.950><c> that</c><00:42:11.130><c> like</c><00:42:11.520><c> we</c><00:42:11.610><c> didn't</c><00:42:11.790><c> think</c><00:42:11.850><c> about</c>

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
we knew that like we didn't think about
 

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.820 align:start position:0%
we knew that like we didn't think about
it<00:42:12.150><c> like</c><00:42:12.240><c> that</c><00:42:12.480><c> time</c><00:42:12.780><c> though</c><00:42:13.020><c> our</c><00:42:13.290><c> model</c>

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:13.830 align:start position:0%
it like that time though our model
 

00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
it like that time though our model
essentially<00:42:14.340><c> is</c><00:42:14.700><c> you</c><00:42:15.450><c> can</c><00:42:15.660><c> make</c><00:42:15.930><c> every</c>

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:16.650 align:start position:0%
essentially is you can make every
 

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:20.630 align:start position:0%
essentially is you can make every
person's<00:42:17.150><c> home</c><00:42:18.150><c> your</c><00:42:18.930><c> house</c><00:42:19.200><c> pretty</c><00:42:20.130><c> much</c><00:42:20.340><c> and</c>

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
person's home your house pretty much and
 

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.030 align:start position:0%
person's home your house pretty much and
so<00:42:21.060><c> but</c><00:42:21.690><c> from</c><00:42:21.960><c> the</c><00:42:22.170><c> beginning</c><00:42:22.290><c> we</c><00:42:22.710><c> you</c><00:42:22.830><c> know</c><00:42:22.920><c> we</c>

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
so but from the beginning we you know we
 

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
so but from the beginning we you know we
were<00:42:23.160><c> essentially</c><00:42:23.490><c> trying</c><00:42:23.820><c> to</c><00:42:23.910><c> solve</c><00:42:24.090><c> the</c>

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:24.330 align:start position:0%
were essentially trying to solve the
 

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.660 align:start position:0%
were essentially trying to solve the
Craigslist<00:42:24.570><c> issue</c><00:42:25.170><c> which</c><00:42:25.590><c> is</c><00:42:25.800><c> you</c><00:42:26.460><c> go</c><00:42:26.610><c> to</c>

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:26.670 align:start position:0%
Craigslist issue which is you go to
 

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
Craigslist issue which is you go to
somebody's<00:42:27.000><c> house</c><00:42:27.210><c> and</c><00:42:27.480><c> you</c><00:42:27.630><c> pick</c><00:42:27.840><c> it</c><00:42:27.930><c> up</c><00:42:27.990><c> from</c>

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:28.170 align:start position:0%
somebody's house and you pick it up from
 

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.050 align:start position:0%
somebody's house and you pick it up from
them<00:42:28.350><c> and</c><00:42:28.590><c> you</c><00:42:28.650><c> pay</c><00:42:28.860><c> them</c><00:42:29.010><c> in</c><00:42:29.040><c> cash</c><00:42:29.190><c> and</c><00:42:29.670><c> then</c>

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
them and you pay them in cash and then
 

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:32.210 align:start position:0%
them and you pay them in cash and then
so<00:42:30.300><c> why</c><00:42:30.570><c> don't</c><00:42:30.750><c> you</c><00:42:30.780><c> just</c><00:42:30.960><c> do</c><00:42:31.170><c> that</c><00:42:31.320><c> by</c><00:42:31.800><c> paying</c>

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
so why don't you just do that by paying
 

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
so why don't you just do that by paying
them<00:42:32.400><c> online</c><00:42:32.580><c> and</c><00:42:33.000><c> then</c><00:42:33.360><c> somebody</c><00:42:33.690><c> else</c><00:42:33.840><c> picks</c>

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:34.050 align:start position:0%
them online and then somebody else picks
 

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:35.750 align:start position:0%
them online and then somebody else picks
it<00:42:34.170><c> up</c><00:42:34.230><c> for</c><00:42:34.470><c> you</c><00:42:34.590><c> yeah</c><00:42:34.920><c> and</c><00:42:35.190><c> so</c><00:42:35.370><c> the</c>

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
it up for you yeah and so the
 

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.370 align:start position:0%
it up for you yeah and so the
warehousing<00:42:36.360><c> parties</c><00:42:36.840><c> never</c><00:42:37.020><c> point</c><00:42:37.320><c> of</c>

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
warehousing parties never point of
 

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:41.710 align:start position:0%
warehousing parties never point of
