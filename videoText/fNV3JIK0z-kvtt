I<00:00:34.110><c> actually</c><00:00:34.710><c> think</c><00:00:34.950><c> this</c><00:00:35.100><c> is</c><00:00:35.160><c> broadly</c>

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 align:start position:0%
I actually think this is broadly
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
I actually think this is broadly
applicable<00:00:35.760><c> to</c><00:00:36.090><c> anyone</c><00:00:36.329><c> thinking</c><00:00:37.230><c> about</c>

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 align:start position:0%
applicable to anyone thinking about
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.150 align:start position:0%

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.340 align:start position:0%
raising the core idea behind demo day
the<00:00:41.340><c> reason</c><00:00:41.520><c> it's</c><00:00:41.790><c> so</c><00:00:41.969><c> helpful</c><00:00:42.210><c> for</c><00:00:42.780><c> founders</c>

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 align:start position:0%
the reason it's so helpful for founders
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.690 align:start position:0%
the reason it's so helpful for founders
is<00:00:43.670><c> two</c><00:00:44.670><c> things</c><00:00:44.850><c> one</c><00:00:45.300><c> it</c><00:00:45.570><c> gives</c><00:00:45.840><c> them</c>

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 align:start position:0%
is two things one it gives them

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
than just a one to one spread because
 

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.100 align:start position:0%
