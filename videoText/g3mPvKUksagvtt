you for this stuff and make sure that's
 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
you for this stuff and make sure that's
all<00:06:35.090><c> up</c><00:06:35.300><c> to</c><00:06:35.330><c> Dayton</c><00:06:35.720><c> and</c><00:06:35.990><c> working</c><00:06:36.290><c> pretty</c><00:06:36.440><c> well</c>

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 align:start position:0%
all up to Dayton and working pretty well
 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.730 align:start position:0%
all up to Dayton and working pretty well
so<00:06:36.980><c> yeah</c><00:06:37.460><c> I</c><00:06:37.700><c> think</c><00:06:37.880><c> had</c><00:06:38.360><c> we</c><00:06:38.570><c> have</c><00:06:38.690><c> like</c><00:06:38.960><c> started</c>

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think had we have like started
 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.950 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think had we have like started
you<00:06:39.920><c> know</c><00:06:40.040><c> ten</c><00:06:40.730><c> people</c><00:06:41.120><c> in</c><00:06:41.270><c> an</c><00:06:41.390><c> office</c><00:06:41.540><c> and</c>

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
you know ten people in an office and
 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know ten people in an office and
then<00:06:42.020><c> added</c><00:06:42.830><c> remote</c><00:06:43.100><c> folks</c><00:06:43.340><c> like</c><00:06:43.550><c> we</c><00:06:43.700><c> sure</c>

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850 align:start position:0%
then added remote folks like we sure
 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.220 align:start position:0%
then added remote folks like we sure
certainly<00:06:44.420><c> could</c><00:06:44.570><c> have</c><00:06:44.660><c> gotten</c><00:06:44.840><c> there</c><00:06:45.050><c> I</c><00:06:45.080><c> know</c>

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230 align:start position:0%
certainly could have gotten there I know
 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.750 align:start position:0%
certainly could have gotten there I know
companies<00:06:45.710><c> that</c><00:06:45.740><c> have</c><00:06:46.010><c> done</c><00:06:46.220><c> that</c><00:06:46.400><c> but</c><00:06:46.730><c> I</c>

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
companies that have done that but I
 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.700 align:start position:0%
companies that have done that but I
think<00:06:46.880><c> it's</c><00:06:47.150><c> just</c><00:06:47.330><c> that</c><00:06:47.450><c> you</c><00:06:48.290><c> know</c><00:06:48.380><c> you</c><00:06:48.470><c> have</c>

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 align:start position:0%
think it's just that you know you have
 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
think it's just that you know you have
to<00:06:48.890><c> unlearn</c><00:06:49.670><c> some</c><00:06:49.940><c> stuff</c><00:06:50.180><c> and</c><00:06:50.330><c> then</c><00:06:50.450><c> relearn</c>

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 align:start position:0%
to unlearn some stuff and then relearn
 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.660 align:start position:0%
to unlearn some stuff and then relearn
it<00:06:50.840><c> in</c><00:06:51.440><c> a</c><00:06:51.560><c> different</c><00:06:51.710><c> way</c><00:06:51.920><c> whereas</c><00:06:52.340><c> we</c><00:06:52.460><c> just</c>

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:52.670 align:start position:0%
it in a different way whereas we just
 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.370 align:start position:0%
it in a different way whereas we just
learned<00:06:53.030><c> it</c><00:06:53.180><c> that</c><00:06:53.300><c> way</c><00:06:53.450><c> from</c><00:06:53.660><c> the</c><00:06:53.750><c> get-go</c><00:06:53.930><c> it</c>

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 align:start position:0%
learned it that way from the get-go it
 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.230 align:start position:0%
learned it that way from the get-go it
was<00:06:54.590><c> there</c><00:06:54.770><c> a</c><00:06:54.800><c> point</c><00:06:55.070><c> at</c><00:06:55.400><c> which</c><00:06:55.700><c> like</c><00:06:55.910><c> you</c><00:06:55.940><c> guys</c>

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
was there a point at which like you guys
 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.450 align:start position:0%
was there a point at which like you guys
were<00:06:56.450><c> scaling</c><00:06:56.870><c> up</c><00:06:56.990><c> and</c><00:06:57.200><c> you're</c><00:06:57.320><c> like</c><00:06:57.530><c> oh</c><00:06:57.740><c> we're</c>

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 align:start position:0%
were scaling up and you're like oh we're
 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.130 align:start position:0%
were scaling up and you're like oh we're
we've<00:06:58.760><c> entered</c><00:06:59.060><c> like</c><00:06:59.210><c> a</c><00:06:59.270><c> different</c><00:06:59.600><c> class</c><00:06:59.840><c> of</c>

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:00.140 align:start position:0%
we've entered like a different class of
 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.260 align:start position:0%
we've entered like a different class of
like<00:07:00.500><c> remote</c><00:07:00.830><c> team</c><00:07:01.070><c> size</c><00:07:01.370><c> and</c><00:07:01.970><c> we</c><00:07:02.060><c> have</c><00:07:02.090><c> to</c>

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270 align:start position:0%
like remote team size and we have to
 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.330 align:start position:0%
like remote team size and we have to
handle<00:07:02.540><c> things</c><00:07:02.660><c> differently</c><00:07:03.340><c> yeah</c>

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 align:start position:0%
handle things differently yeah
 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.810 align:start position:0%
handle things differently yeah
definitely<00:07:05.030><c> um</c><00:07:06.220><c> they're</c><00:07:07.220><c> not</c><00:07:07.400><c> and</c><00:07:07.640><c> it's</c><00:07:07.760><c> not</c>

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 align:start position:0%
definitely um they're not and it's not
 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.659 align:start position:0%
definitely um they're not and it's not
too<00:07:08.120><c> different</c><00:07:08.419><c> I</c><00:07:08.690><c> think</c><00:07:08.720><c> from</c><00:07:09.340><c> even</c><00:07:10.340><c> in</c><00:07:10.520><c> look</c>

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 align:start position:0%
too different I think from even in look
 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.550 align:start position:0%
too different I think from even in look
it<00:07:10.970><c> like</c><00:07:11.210><c> co-located</c><00:07:11.900><c> companies</c><00:07:12.230><c> have</c><00:07:12.410><c> like</c>

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
it like co-located companies have like
 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
it like co-located companies have like
those<00:07:12.680><c> inflection</c><00:07:13.190><c> points</c><00:07:13.460><c> to</c><00:07:13.610><c> or</c><00:07:13.730><c> you're</c>

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850 align:start position:0%
those inflection points to or you're
 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.820 align:start position:0%
those inflection points to or you're
like<00:07:14.030><c> we</c><00:07:14.720><c> need</c><00:07:14.750><c> to</c><00:07:14.960><c> change</c><00:07:15.230><c> some</c><00:07:15.500><c> stuff</c><00:07:15.680><c> up</c>

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 align:start position:0%
like we need to change some stuff up
 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.980 align:start position:0%
like we need to change some stuff up
because<00:07:15.950><c> it's</c><00:07:16.160><c> not</c><00:07:16.280><c> working</c><00:07:16.669><c> and</c><00:07:16.820><c> so</c><00:07:16.880><c> for</c><00:07:17.870><c> us</c>

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
because it's not working and so for us
 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.470 align:start position:0%
because it's not working and so for us
like<00:07:18.320><c> the</c><00:07:18.650><c> there's</c><00:07:19.250><c> about</c><00:07:19.580><c> three</c><00:07:20.270><c> of</c><00:07:20.390><c> them</c>

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
like the there's about three of them
 

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.390 align:start position:0%
like the there's about three of them
where<00:07:20.690><c> we've</c><00:07:20.840><c> kind</c><00:07:21.080><c> of</c><00:07:21.169><c> had</c><00:07:21.260><c> to</c><00:07:21.350><c> really</c><00:07:21.590><c> not</c>

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
where we've kind of had to really not
 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
where we've kind of had to really not
reinvent<00:07:22.940><c> ourselves</c><00:07:23.110><c> start</c><00:07:24.110><c> to</c><00:07:24.200><c> rethink</c><00:07:24.500><c> a</c>

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 align:start position:0%
reinvent ourselves start to rethink a
 

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.590 align:start position:0%
reinvent ourselves start to rethink a
few<00:07:25.430><c> things</c><00:07:25.669><c> so</c><00:07:25.820><c> the</c><00:07:25.910><c> first</c><00:07:26.120><c> one</c><00:07:26.270><c> was</c><00:07:26.360><c> around</c>

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
few things so the first one was around
 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.020 align:start position:0%
few things so the first one was around
like<00:07:26.750><c> 20</c><00:07:27.169><c> people</c><00:07:27.530><c> which</c><00:07:27.740><c> was</c><00:07:27.980><c> up</c><00:07:28.550><c> until</c><00:07:28.910><c> that</c>

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.030 align:start position:0%
like 20 people which was up until that
 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.230 align:start position:0%
like 20 people which was up until that
point<00:07:29.620><c> like</c><00:07:30.620><c> I</c><00:07:30.710><c> was</c><00:07:30.890><c> the</c><00:07:31.010><c> sole</c><00:07:31.220><c> manager</c><00:07:32.000><c> but</c>

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
point like I was the sole manager but
 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.270 align:start position:0%
point like I was the sole manager but
like<00:07:32.390><c> not</c><00:07:32.720><c> really</c><00:07:33.320><c> management</c><00:07:34.010><c> like</c><00:07:34.130><c> when</c>

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
like not really management like when
 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.710 align:start position:0%
like not really management like when
it's<00:07:34.430><c> less</c><00:07:34.580><c> than</c><00:07:34.700><c> 20</c><00:07:35.030><c> everything</c><00:07:35.390><c> kind</c><00:07:35.630><c> of</c>

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
it's less than 20 everything kind of
 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.770 align:start position:0%
it's less than 20 everything kind of
self<00:07:36.460><c> happened</c><00:07:37.460><c> so</c><00:07:37.640><c> like</c><00:07:37.790><c> me</c><00:07:37.940><c> and</c><00:07:38.150><c> Brian</c><00:07:38.600><c> and</c>

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.730 align:start position:0%
got to about 20 or so it's like actually
they're<00:07:44.840><c> starting</c><00:07:45.080><c> to</c><00:07:45.169><c> be</c><00:07:45.229><c> some</c><00:07:45.350><c> coordination</c>

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:03.500 align:start position:0%
40 it got 40 to 50 or so it got even
 

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.659 align:start position:0%
40 it got 40 to 50 or so it got even
more<00:08:03.650><c> complex</c><00:08:04.040><c> and</c><00:08:04.450><c> we</c><00:08:05.450><c> added</c><00:08:06.229><c> more</c><00:08:06.680><c> managers</c>

00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:07.669 align:start position:0%
more complex and we added more managers
 

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:10.870 align:start position:0%
more complex and we added more managers
and<00:08:08.630><c> then</c><00:08:09.020><c> that</c><00:08:09.770><c> was</c><00:08:09.979><c> like</c><00:08:10.010><c> the</c><00:08:10.430><c> first</c><00:08:10.669><c> time</c>

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
and then that was like the first time
 

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.890 align:start position:0%
and then that was like the first time
where<00:08:11.240><c> I</c><00:08:11.570><c> was</c><00:08:12.350><c> solely</c><00:08:12.770><c> managing</c><00:08:13.520><c> other</c>

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:25.149 align:start position:0%

00:15:41.849 --> 00:15:41.859 align:start position:0%
hard to bootstrap so yeah like allowed
 

00:15:41.859 --> 00:15:44.849 align:start position:0%
hard to bootstrap so yeah like allowed
us<00:15:42.100><c> to</c><00:15:43.019><c> experiment</c><00:15:44.019><c> with</c><00:15:44.139><c> a</c><00:15:44.169><c> business</c><00:15:44.379><c> model</c><00:15:44.529><c> a</c>

it was like all right I'm just going to
 

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
it was like all right I'm just going to

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:23.140 align:start position:0%
playing with folks it didn't even matter
 

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
playing with folks it didn't even matter
so<00:38:23.560><c> it</c><00:38:23.620><c> was</c><00:38:23.740><c> like</c><00:38:23.860><c> this</c><00:38:24.430><c> is</c><00:38:24.610><c> the</c><00:38:24.640><c> shot</c><00:38:24.940><c> I'm</c>

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:25.150 align:start position:0%
so it was like this is the shot I'm
 

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:27.930 align:start position:0%
so it was like this is the shot I'm
going<00:38:25.270><c> to</c><00:38:25.360><c> take</c><00:38:26.220><c> even</c><00:38:27.220><c> if</c><00:38:27.340><c> that</c><00:38:27.460><c> wasn't</c><00:38:27.850><c> the</c>

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:27.940 align:start position:0%
going to take even if that wasn't the
 

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
going to take even if that wasn't the
right<00:38:28.120><c> shot</c><00:38:28.450><c> to</c><00:38:28.600><c> take</c><00:38:28.780><c> in</c><00:38:28.930><c> that</c><00:38:28.960><c> moment</c><00:38:29.290><c> was</c>

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:29.650 align:start position:0%
right shot to take in that moment was
 

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.170 align:start position:0%
right shot to take in that moment was
like<00:38:29.800><c> I'm</c><00:38:30.040><c> going</c><00:38:30.280><c> to</c><00:38:30.340><c> make</c><00:38:30.490><c> that</c><00:38:30.640><c> shot</c><00:38:30.850><c> anyway</c>

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:31.180 align:start position:0%
like I'm going to make that shot anyway
 

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
