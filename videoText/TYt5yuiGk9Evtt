00:25:47.419 --> 00:25:47.429 align:start position:0%
I think all the evidence is on the side
 

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:49.340 align:start position:0%
I think all the evidence is on the side
of<00:25:47.460><c> doing</c><00:25:47.700><c> this</c><00:25:47.940><c> and</c><00:25:48.179><c> yet</c><00:25:48.659><c> almost</c><00:25:48.809><c> no</c><00:25:49.019><c> one</c><00:25:49.110><c> does</c>

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.350 align:start position:0%
of doing this and yet almost no one does
 

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.899 align:start position:0%
of doing this and yet almost no one does
so<00:25:49.590><c> there's</c><00:25:49.799><c> like</c><00:25:49.950><c> a</c><00:25:49.980><c> huge</c><00:25:50.399><c> edge</c><00:25:50.610><c> if</c><00:25:50.789><c> you're</c>
