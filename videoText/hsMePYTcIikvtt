00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 align:start position:0%

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
instead yeah I think this a lot of this

it like what what is the test is my

then<00:32:44.539><c> before</c><00:32:44.720><c> you</c><00:32:45.289><c> get</c><00:32:45.590><c> overwhelmed</c><00:32:46.220><c> by</c><00:32:46.400><c> the</c>

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:46.460 align:start position:0%
then before you get overwhelmed by the
 

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.669 align:start position:0%
then before you get overwhelmed by the

00:32:48.669 --> 00:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
problem because often you're told like
 

00:32:48.679 --> 00:32:50.169 align:start position:0%
problem because often you're told like
hey<00:32:48.890><c> you</c><00:32:48.950><c> have</c><00:32:49.190><c> to</c><00:32:49.309><c> take</c><00:32:49.340><c> route</c><00:32:49.669><c> a</c><00:32:49.850><c> or</c><00:32:50.000><c> B</c>

hey you have to take route a or B
 

00:32:50.179 --> 00:32:52.690 align:start position:0%
hey you have to take route a or B
usually<00:32:50.750><c> there's</c><00:32:51.230><c> options</c><00:32:51.830><c> like</c><00:32:52.010><c> C</c><00:32:52.309><c> through</c>

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:52.700 align:start position:0%
usually there's options like C through
 

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.419 align:start position:0%
usually there's options like C through
infinity<00:32:53.450><c> right</c><00:32:54.200><c> and</c><00:32:54.650><c> so</c><00:32:54.950><c> you</c><00:32:55.039><c> have</c><00:32:55.220><c> to</c><00:32:55.340><c> ask</c>

00:32:55.419 --> 00:32:55.429 align:start position:0%
infinity right and so you have to ask
 

00:32:55.429 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
infinity right and so you have to ask
why<00:32:55.760><c> and</c><00:32:56.059><c> so</c><00:32:56.240><c> how</c><00:32:56.419><c> do</c><00:32:56.480><c> you</c><00:32:56.780><c> whether</c><00:32:57.200><c> it's</c>

00:32:57.399 --> 00:32:57.409 align:start position:0%
why and so how do you whether it's
 

00:32:57.409 --> 00:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
why and so how do you whether it's
through<00:32:57.620><c> interviews</c><00:32:58.070><c> or</c><00:32:58.400><c> training</c><00:32:59.000><c> get</c><00:32:59.840><c> that</c>

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
through interviews or training get that

00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:44.839 align:start position:0%
were you in looking for dragons right
 

00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:46.659 align:start position:0%
were you in looking for dragons right

and anticipating these these like

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.190 align:start position:0%
problems and then you know you don't
necessarily<00:34:49.700><c> need</c><00:34:50.119><c> to</c><00:34:50.270><c> solve</c><00:34:50.510><c> all</c><00:34:50.659><c> of</c><00:34:50.690><c> them</c><00:34:50.960><c> we</c>

necessarily need to solve all of them we

necessarily need to solve all of them we

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:52.700 align:start position:0%
need to be aware of them because they
 

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.540 align:start position:0%
need to be aware of them because they
actually<00:34:52.960><c> can</c><00:34:53.960><c> distort</c><00:34:54.470><c> your</c><00:34:54.649><c> findings</c><00:34:55.250><c> and</c>

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:55.550 align:start position:0%
actually can distort your findings and
 

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:58.569 align:start position:0%
actually can distort your findings and

so as long as you like if you identify
 

00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
so as long as you like if you identify

that you know hey like I found this
 

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.630 align:start position:0%
that you know hey like I found this
thing<00:35:05.290><c> but</c><00:35:06.290><c> I</c><00:35:06.560><c> made</c><00:35:06.800><c> this</c><00:35:06.980><c> like</c><00:35:07.400><c> I</c>

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
thing but I made this like I
 

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.579 align:start position:0%
thing but I made this like I
deliberately<00:35:08.480><c> made</c><00:35:08.810><c> this</c><00:35:08.960><c> assumption</c><00:35:09.380><c> the</c>

00:35:09.579 --> 00:35:09.589 align:start position:0%
deliberately made this assumption the
 

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:11.230 align:start position:0%
deliberately made this assumption the
simplifying<00:35:10.040><c> assumption</c><00:35:10.609><c> so</c><00:35:11.000><c> I</c><00:35:11.060><c> could</c>

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
simplifying assumption so I could
 

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.670 align:start position:0%
simplifying assumption so I could
complete<00:35:11.599><c> it</c><00:35:11.750><c> in</c><00:35:11.930><c> a</c><00:35:12.020><c> reasonable</c><00:35:12.440><c> amount</c><00:35:12.470><c> of</c>

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
complete it in a reasonable amount of
 

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
complete it in a reasonable amount of
time<00:35:12.770><c> like</c><00:35:13.099><c> that's</c><00:35:13.400><c> fine</c><00:35:13.670><c> so</c><00:35:14.420><c> the</c><00:35:14.540><c> good</c><00:35:14.660><c> people</c>

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:14.690 align:start position:0%
time like that's fine so the good people
 

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.290 align:start position:0%
time like that's fine so the good people
what<00:35:15.109><c> they're</c><00:35:15.290><c> good</c><00:35:15.530><c> at</c><00:35:15.560><c> is</c><00:35:16.040><c> like</c><00:35:16.300><c> not</c>

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:17.300 align:start position:0%
what they're good at is like not
 

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
what they're good at is like not

hmmm<00:40:01.500><c> I</c><00:40:01.680><c> think</c><00:40:02.340><c> part</c><00:40:03.030><c> of</c><00:40:03.090><c> it</c><00:40:03.180><c> was</c><00:40:03.210><c> like</c><00:40:03.420><c> the</c>

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
hmmm I think part of it was like the

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.490 align:start position:0%

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
no diligently and also if it turns out I
 

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.550 align:start position:0%
no diligently and also if it turns out I
was<00:40:13.590><c> like</c><00:40:13.740><c> oh</c><00:40:13.890><c> I</c><00:40:14.630><c> can</c><00:40:15.630><c> see</c><00:40:15.810><c> a</c><00:40:15.840><c> human</c><00:40:16.290><c> getting</c>

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
was like oh I can see a human getting
 

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.780 align:start position:0%
was like oh I can see a human getting
really<00:40:16.740><c> frustrated</c><00:40:17.220><c> where</c><00:40:17.310><c> it's</c><00:40:17.430><c> like</c><00:40:17.520><c> this</c>

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:17.790 align:start position:0%
really frustrated where it's like this
 

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.610 align:start position:0%
really frustrated where it's like this
is<00:40:17.910><c> the</c><00:40:17.940><c> 50th</c><00:40:18.480><c> time</c><00:40:18.510><c> I</c><00:40:18.750><c> had</c><00:40:18.990><c> the</c><00:40:19.080><c> correct</c><00:40:19.380><c> that</c>

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
is the 50th time I had the correct that
 

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:21.230 align:start position:0%
is the 50th time I had the correct that
this<00:40:19.770><c> is</c><00:40:19.920><c> coming</c><00:40:20.220><c> from</c><00:40:20.250><c> McDonald's</c><00:40:21.090><c> and</c>

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
this is coming from McDonald's and
 

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.670 align:start position:0%
this is coming from McDonald's and
therefore<00:40:21.690><c> like</c><00:40:21.810><c> I</c><00:40:21.930><c> no</c><00:40:21.990><c> longer</c><00:40:22.320><c> want</c><00:40:22.620><c> to</c>

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
therefore like I no longer want to
 

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
therefore like I no longer want to
correct<00:40:22.890><c> this</c><00:40:22.980><c> anymore</c><00:40:23.250><c> because</c><00:40:23.580><c> like</c><00:40:23.790><c> this</c>

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:23.970 align:start position:0%
correct this anymore because like this
 

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
correct this anymore because like this
is<00:40:24.090><c> just</c><00:40:24.270><c> not</c><00:40:24.390><c> any</c><00:40:24.540><c> good</c><00:40:24.810><c> and</c><00:40:25.020><c> so</c><00:40:25.500><c> the</c><00:40:25.680><c> problem</c>

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:25.890 align:start position:0%
is just not any good and so the problem
 

00:40:25.890 --> 00:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
is just not any good and so the problem
actually<00:40:26.100><c> is</c><00:40:26.400><c> like</c><00:40:26.520><c> all</c><00:40:26.910><c> of</c><00:40:27.000><c> them</c><00:40:27.120><c> are</c><00:40:27.240><c> so</c>

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:27.330 align:start position:0%
actually is like all of them are so
 

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.930 align:start position:0%
actually is like all of them are so
different<00:40:27.780><c> and</c><00:40:27.900><c> so</c><00:40:28.410><c> humans</c><00:40:29.100><c> are</c><00:40:29.190><c> giving</c><00:40:29.580><c> up</c><00:40:29.760><c> on</c>

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:29.940 align:start position:0%
different and so humans are giving up on
 

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
different and so humans are giving up on
the<00:40:30.060><c> classification</c><00:40:30.450><c> when</c><00:40:30.990><c> really</c><00:40:31.200><c> it's</c><00:40:31.380><c> like</c>

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
the classification when really it's like
 

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.100 align:start position:0%
the classification when really it's like
actually<00:40:33.000><c> I</c><00:40:33.090><c> have</c><00:40:33.180><c> like</c><00:40:33.360><c> such</c><00:40:33.570><c> limited</c>

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.110 align:start position:0%
actually I have like such limited
 

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
actually I have like such limited

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:05.550 align:start position:0%
know so we endeavor to figure out all

the ways in which it isn't
representative<00:43:06.280><c> and</c><00:43:06.610><c> then</c><00:43:07.030><c> apply</c>

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:07.420 align:start position:0%
representative and then apply
 

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative and then apply

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:09.490 align:start position:0%
corrections to make sure that you know
 

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
corrections to make sure that you know
whatever<00:43:09.670><c> results</c><00:43:10.240><c> you</c><00:43:10.360><c> get</c><00:43:10.540><c> do</c><00:43:11.290><c> you</c>

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:11.350 align:start position:0%
whatever results you get do you
 

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.470 align:start position:0%
whatever results you get do you
represent<00:43:11.530><c> the</c><00:43:11.920><c> greater</c><00:43:12.100><c> population</c><00:43:12.480><c> so</c>

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
represent the greater population so
 

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.030 align:start position:0%
represent the greater population so
anyway<00:43:13.750><c> so</c><00:43:13.810><c> that's</c><00:43:14.110><c> that's</c><00:43:14.620><c> one</c><00:43:14.830><c> thing</c><00:43:15.010><c> that</c>

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
anyway so that's that's one thing that
 

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.590 align:start position:0%
anyway so that's that's one thing that
we're<00:43:15.220><c> building</c><00:43:15.340><c> is</c><00:43:15.610><c> this</c><00:43:15.760><c> this</c><00:43:16.060><c> pipeline</c><00:43:16.360><c> and</c>

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
we're building is this this pipeline and
 

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
we're building is this this pipeline and
we've<00:43:16.870><c> got</c><00:43:17.100><c> 10</c><00:43:18.100><c> to</c><00:43:18.430><c> 15</c><00:43:18.970><c> people</c><00:43:19.210><c> working</c><00:43:19.630><c> on</c>

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:19.870 align:start position:0%
we've got 10 to 15 people working on
 

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
we've got 10 to 15 people working on
that<00:43:19.900><c> but</c><00:43:20.890><c> then</c><00:43:21.010><c> we</c><00:43:21.100><c> also</c><00:43:21.310><c> have</c><00:43:21.610><c> our</c><00:43:21.640><c> analytics</c>

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:22.330 align:start position:0%
that but then we also have our analytics
 

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.290 align:start position:0%
that but then we also have our analytics
platform<00:43:22.840><c> right</c><00:43:23.470><c> this</c><00:43:23.710><c> is</c><00:43:23.920><c> the</c><00:43:24.160><c> think</c><00:43:25.120><c> of</c><00:43:25.210><c> it</c>

are like corporations doing this for
like<00:43:42.730><c> sort</c><00:43:43.000><c> of</c><00:43:43.090><c> I</c><00:43:43.270><c> guess</c><00:43:43.360><c> competitive</c>

00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
like sort of I guess competitive
 

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
like sort of I guess competitive
analysis<00:43:44.940><c> yeah</c><00:43:46.320><c> how</c><00:43:47.320><c> did</c><00:43:47.380><c> that</c><00:43:47.530><c> come</c><00:43:47.770><c> up</c>

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.010 align:start position:0%
analysis yeah how did that come up
 

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
analysis yeah how did that come up
and<00:43:48.250><c> so</c><00:43:48.430><c> like</c><00:43:48.610><c> why</c><00:43:48.790><c> is</c><00:43:48.850><c> that</c><00:43:49.090><c> I</c><00:43:49.270><c> mean</c><00:43:49.540><c> I</c><00:43:49.570><c> can</c><00:43:49.780><c> see</c>

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:49.990 align:start position:0%
and so like why is that I mean I can see
 

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.210 align:start position:0%
and so like why is that I mean I can see
why<00:43:50.140><c> it</c><00:43:50.200><c> would</c><00:43:50.290><c> be</c><00:43:50.410><c> interesting</c><00:43:50.800><c> to</c><00:43:50.830><c> them</c><00:43:50.980><c> but</c>

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:51.220 align:start position:0%
why it would be interesting to them but
 

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.050 align:start position:0%
why it would be interesting to them but
I'm<00:43:51.310><c> just</c><00:43:51.400><c> wondering</c><00:43:52.950><c> are</c><00:43:53.950><c> they</c><00:43:54.520><c> looking</c><00:43:54.970><c> at</c>

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:55.060 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering are they looking at
 

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering are they looking at
questions<00:43:55.510><c> very</c><00:43:56.080><c> differently</c><00:43:56.680><c> when</c><00:43:57.160><c> they're</c>

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:57.250 align:start position:0%
questions very differently when they're
 

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
questions very differently when they're
looking<00:43:57.580><c> at</c><00:43:57.670><c> your</c><00:43:58.000><c> platform</c><00:43:58.510><c> to</c><00:43:58.630><c> answer</c><00:43:58.960><c> them</c>

00:43:59.100 --> 00:43:59.110 align:start position:0%
looking at your platform to answer them
 

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
looking at your platform to answer them
yeah<00:43:59.980><c> I</c><00:44:00.010><c> think</c><00:44:00.150><c> this</c><00:44:01.150><c> is</c><00:44:01.360><c> like</c><00:44:01.570><c> this</c><00:44:01.780><c> is</c><00:44:01.840><c> a</c>

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:01.990 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this is like this is a
 

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.210 align:start position:0%
yeah I think this is like this is a
really<00:44:02.320><c> interesting</c><00:44:02.530><c> journey</c><00:44:02.920><c> for</c><00:44:03.190><c> us</c>

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:03.220 align:start position:0%
really interesting journey for us
 

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
really interesting journey for us
because<00:44:03.460><c> you</c><00:44:03.880><c> know</c><00:44:03.940><c> we</c><00:44:04.060><c> started</c><00:44:04.390><c> out</c><00:44:04.510><c> building</c>

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:05.350 align:start position:0%
because you know we started out building
 

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
because you know we started out building
a<00:44:05.410><c> platform</c><00:44:05.890><c> that</c><00:44:05.950><c> was</c><00:44:06.070><c> focused</c><00:44:06.400><c> on</c><00:44:06.550><c> helping</c>
