00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:23.570 align:start position:0%
for the Dustin TV case was that we
 

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
for the Dustin TV case was that we
didn't<00:09:23.930><c> have</c><00:09:24.110><c> a</c><00:09:24.170><c> repeatable</c><00:09:25.100><c> engine</c><00:09:25.670><c> to</c>

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:25.850 align:start position:0%
didn't have a repeatable engine to

didn't have a repeatable engine to

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:28.310 align:start position:0%
create growth like that 300 million
 

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:29.830 align:start position:0%
create growth like that 300 million
monthly<00:09:28.580><c> uniques</c><00:09:28.850><c> we</c><00:09:29.150><c> couldn't</c><00:09:29.570><c> make</c><00:09:29.690><c> that</c>

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
monthly uniques we couldn't make that
 

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.830 align:start position:0%
monthly uniques we couldn't make that
number<00:09:30.050><c> go</c><00:09:30.410><c> up</c><00:09:31.060><c> and</c><00:09:32.060><c> then</c><00:09:32.210><c> the</c><00:09:32.300><c> second</c><00:09:32.690><c> thing</c>

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
number go up and then the second thing
 

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.450 align:start position:0%
number go up and then the second thing
was<00:09:32.960><c> that</c><00:09:33.020><c> unfortunately</c><00:09:33.830><c> we</c><00:09:34.010><c> were</c><00:09:34.130><c> we</c><00:09:34.370><c> had</c>

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:34.460 align:start position:0%
was that unfortunately we were we had
 

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.460 align:start position:0%
was that unfortunately we were we had
tons<00:09:34.760><c> of</c><00:09:34.910><c> a</c><00:09:35.030><c> copper</c><00:09:35.420><c> and</c><00:09:35.510><c> content</c><00:09:35.990><c> on</c><00:09:36.110><c> the</c><00:09:36.230><c> site</c>

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:36.470 align:start position:0%
tons of a copper and content on the site
 

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
tons of a copper and content on the site
yeah<00:09:36.800><c> and</c><00:09:37.040><c> so</c><00:09:37.430><c> it</c><00:09:38.210><c> wasn't</c><00:09:38.570><c> we</c><00:09:39.170><c> weren't</c><00:09:39.440><c> able</c><00:09:39.590><c> to</c>

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:39.770 align:start position:0%
yeah and so it wasn't we weren't able to
 

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.250 align:start position:0%
yeah and so it wasn't we weren't able to
reliably<00:09:40.340><c> monetize</c><00:09:41.060><c> that</c><00:09:41.300><c> over</c><00:09:41.510><c> time</c><00:09:41.690><c> right</c>

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.260 align:start position:0%
reliably monetize that over time right
 

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
reliably monetize that over time right
and<00:09:42.950><c> so</c><00:09:43.220><c> it's</c><00:09:43.370><c> like</c><00:09:43.900><c> it's</c><00:09:44.900><c> funny</c><00:09:45.200><c> because</c><00:09:45.470><c> I</c>

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:45.890 align:start position:0%
and so it's like it's funny because I
 

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.250 align:start position:0%
and so it's like it's funny because I
can't<00:09:46.610><c> imagine</c><00:09:46.760><c> how</c><00:09:47.330><c> many</c><00:09:47.540><c> pitches</c><00:09:47.870><c> that</c><00:09:48.200><c> I</c>

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:48.260 align:start position:0%
can't imagine how many pitches that I
 

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.620 align:start position:0%
can't imagine how many pitches that I
gave<00:09:48.590><c> to</c><00:09:48.920><c> trying</c><00:09:49.580><c> to</c><00:09:49.670><c> present</c><00:09:49.880><c> that</c><00:09:50.210><c> as</c><00:09:50.360><c> a</c><00:09:50.390><c> good</c>

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:50.630 align:start position:0%
gave to trying to present that as a good
 

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.630 align:start position:0%
gave to trying to present that as a good
business<00:09:51.050><c> when</c><00:09:51.290><c> like</c><00:09:51.440><c> in</c><00:09:51.650><c> my</c><00:09:51.890><c> heart</c><00:09:52.160><c> I</c><00:09:52.370><c> knew</c><00:09:52.520><c> it</c>

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
business when like in my heart I knew it
 

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.190 align:start position:0%
business when like in my heart I knew it
wasn't<00:09:52.880><c> a</c><00:09:53.120><c> good</c><00:09:53.270><c> business</c><00:09:53.630><c> yeah</c><00:09:53.810><c> and</c><00:09:53.930><c> I</c><00:09:54.020><c> mean</c>

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't a good business yeah and I mean
 

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.770 align:start position:0%
wasn't a good business yeah and I mean
like<00:09:54.410><c> and</c><00:09:54.590><c> like</c><00:09:55.310><c> it</c><00:09:55.520><c> wasn't</c><00:09:55.940><c> until</c><00:09:56.390><c> we</c>

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:56.780 align:start position:0%
like and like it wasn't until we
 

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.870 align:start position:0%
