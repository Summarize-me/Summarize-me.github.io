00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:34.630 align:start position:0%
little harder is because we're kind of
saying<00:11:32.079><c> that</c><00:11:32.240><c> the</c><00:11:32.399><c> good</c><00:11:32.720><c> point</c><00:11:33.040><c> is</c><00:11:33.279><c> optimistic</c>

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
saying that the good point is optimistic
 

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
saying that the good point is optimistic
so

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.790 align:start position:0%
so
if<00:11:35.760><c> you're</c><00:11:36.079><c> too</c>

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
if you're too
 

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.310 align:start position:0%
if you're too

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
optimistic about your startup you're
 

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
optimistic about your startup you're
like

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
like
 

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.190 align:start position:0%
like
way<00:11:39.519><c> off</c><00:11:39.839><c> in</c><00:11:39.920><c> the</c><00:11:40.160><c> never</c><00:11:40.399><c> never</c><00:11:40.720><c> land</c><00:11:41.360><c> and</c><00:11:41.600><c> like</c>

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
way off in the never never land and like
 

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.430 align:start position:0%
way off in the never never land and like
that's<00:11:43.519><c> a</c><00:11:43.600><c> harder</c><00:11:44.079><c> thing</c><00:11:44.399><c> for</c><00:11:44.560><c> us</c><00:11:44.800><c> to</c><00:11:45.120><c> uh</c><00:11:45.760><c> to</c>

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's a harder thing for us to uh to
 

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.430 align:start position:0%
that's a harder thing for us to uh to
that's<00:11:47.680><c> a</c><00:11:47.760><c> harder</c><00:11:48.000><c> thing</c><00:11:48.160><c> for</c><00:11:48.320><c> us</c><00:11:48.399><c> to</c><00:11:48.560><c> cure</c><00:11:48.880><c> so</c>

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's a harder thing for us to cure so
 

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.110 align:start position:0%
that's a harder thing for us to cure so
