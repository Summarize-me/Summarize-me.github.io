well let's see if first off I didn't
 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.769 align:start position:0%
well let's see if first off I didn't
have<00:07:40.520><c> much</c><00:07:40.639><c> in</c><00:07:40.789><c> savings</c><00:07:41.180><c> and</c><00:07:41.419><c> I'm</c><00:07:41.539><c> not</c><00:07:41.689><c> an</c>

have much in savings and I'm not an
 

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:43.659 align:start position:0%
have much in savings and I'm not an
engineer<00:07:41.900><c> and</c><00:07:42.319><c> so</c><00:07:42.469><c> that</c><00:07:43.129><c> was</c><00:07:43.310><c> one</c><00:07:43.490><c> of</c><00:07:43.580><c> the</c>

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:43.669 align:start position:0%
engineer and so that was one of the
 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:45.670 align:start position:0%
engineer and so that was one of the
things<00:07:44.060><c> as</c><00:07:44.210><c> well</c><00:07:44.389><c> I</c><00:07:44.419><c> need</c><00:07:44.659><c> people</c><00:07:45.229><c> to</c><00:07:45.379><c> help</c><00:07:45.500><c> me</c>

to<00:07:45.919><c> build</c><00:07:46.039><c> this</c><00:07:46.250><c> thing</c><00:07:46.310><c> and</c><00:07:46.669><c> build</c><00:07:46.729><c> out</c><00:07:46.939><c> know</c>

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:47.300 align:start position:0%
to build this thing and build out know
 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.170 align:start position:0%
to build this thing and build out know
this<00:07:47.689><c> roadmap</c><00:07:47.930><c> that</c><00:07:48.259><c> I</c><00:07:48.289><c> have</c><00:07:48.439><c> in</c><00:07:48.529><c> my</c><00:07:48.620><c> brain</c><00:07:48.680><c> and</c>

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:49.180 align:start position:0%
this roadmap that I have in my brain and
 

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.839 align:start position:0%
this roadmap that I have in my brain and
and<00:07:50.180><c> so</c><00:07:50.569><c> one</c><00:07:51.529><c> way</c><00:07:51.740><c> of</c><00:07:51.770><c> to</c><00:07:52.159><c> do</c><00:07:52.250><c> that</c><00:07:52.430><c> is</c><00:07:52.580><c> you</c><00:07:52.729><c> get</c>

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:52.849 align:start position:0%
and so one way of to do that is you get
 

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:54.339 align:start position:0%
and so one way of to do that is you get
money<00:07:53.120><c> to</c><00:07:53.300><c> pay</c><00:07:53.479><c> them</c><00:07:53.659><c> well</c><00:07:53.839><c> how</c><00:07:53.930><c> to</c><00:07:53.990><c> get</c><00:07:54.169><c> money</c>

my guess
 

00:08:55.329 --> 00:08:56.369 align:start position:0%

I've<00:08:55.480><c> actually</c><00:08:55.600><c> talked</c><00:08:55.899><c> to</c><00:08:55.930><c> him</c><00:08:56.019><c> about</c><00:08:56.139><c> this</c>

I've actually talked to him about this
 

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:58.230 align:start position:0%
I've actually talked to him about this

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
so yeah I don't think that'll be his
 

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.389 align:start position:0%
so yeah I don't think that'll be his

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:45.270 align:start position:0%
that's that's where I think maybe it

that's that's where I think maybe it

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:46.890 align:start position:0%

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:42.690 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change anything
 

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change anything
like<00:21:42.870><c> yeah</c><00:21:43.020><c> that's</c><00:21:43.410><c> a</c><00:21:43.530><c> valid</c><00:21:43.710><c> option</c><00:21:44.130><c> it's</c>

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:44.970 align:start position:0%
like yeah that's a valid option it's
 

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.070 align:start position:0%
like yeah that's a valid option it's
yeah<00:21:45.240><c> it's</c><00:21:45.390><c> one</c><00:21:45.480><c> of</c><00:21:45.510><c> those</c><00:21:45.660><c> things</c><00:21:45.870><c> cuz</c>

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah it's one of those things cuz
 

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
yeah it's one of those things cuz
there's<00:21:46.440><c> a</c><00:21:46.530><c> lot</c><00:21:46.680><c> of</c><00:21:46.800><c> mistakes</c><00:21:46.920><c> I</c><00:21:47.220><c> made</c><00:21:47.400><c> of</c>

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of mistakes I made of
 

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.910 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of mistakes I made of
course<00:21:47.730><c> and</c><00:21:48.150><c> so</c><00:21:48.270><c> I</c><00:21:48.410><c> when</c><00:21:49.410><c> I</c><00:21:49.440><c> think</c><00:21:49.650><c> about</c><00:21:49.710><c> the</c>

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
course and so I when I think about the
 

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.050 align:start position:0%
course and so I when I think about the
mistakes<00:21:50.250><c> I</c><00:21:50.370><c> think</c><00:21:50.520><c> well</c><00:21:50.640><c> I</c><00:21:50.670><c> should</c><00:21:50.850><c> have</c><00:21:50.910><c> done</c>

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
mistakes I think well I should have done
 

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.310 align:start position:0%
mistakes I think well I should have done
differently<00:21:51.120><c> and</c><00:21:51.540><c> then</c><00:21:51.750><c> there's</c><00:21:52.200><c> another</c>

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
differently and then there's another
 

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
differently and then there's another
part<00:21:52.530><c> of</c><00:21:52.650><c> me</c><00:21:52.770><c> though</c><00:21:52.890><c> that</c><00:21:53.040><c> thinks</c><00:21:53.340><c> well</c><00:21:53.930><c> with</c>

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:54.930 align:start position:0%
part of me though that thinks well with
 

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.450 align:start position:0%
part of me though that thinks well with
the<00:21:55.020><c> information</c><00:21:55.380><c> I</c><00:21:55.440><c> had</c><00:21:55.560><c> at</c><00:21:55.740><c> the</c><00:21:55.890><c> time</c><00:21:56.130><c> I</c>

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
the information I had at the time I
 

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.770 align:start position:0%
the information I had at the time I
probably<00:21:56.520><c> still</c><00:21:57.210><c> would</c><00:21:57.330><c> have</c><00:21:57.450><c> made</c><00:21:57.570><c> the</c><00:21:57.660><c> same</c>

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
probably still would have made the same
 

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.330 align:start position:0%
probably still would have made the same
decision<00:21:57.840><c> so</c><00:21:58.380><c> the</c><00:21:58.470><c> reality</c><00:21:58.680><c> is</c><00:21:58.890><c> I</c><00:21:59.010><c> don't</c><00:21:59.040><c> think</c>

00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
decision so the reality is I don't think
 

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.770 align:start position:0%
decision so the reality is I don't think
things<00:21:59.430><c> would</c><00:21:59.640><c> have</c><00:21:59.730><c> changed</c><00:21:59.760><c> and</c><00:22:00.210><c> it's</c><00:22:00.660><c> also</c>

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
things would have changed and it's also
 

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.510 align:start position:0%
things would have changed and it's also
hard<00:22:01.050><c> to</c><00:22:01.110><c> know</c><00:22:01.380><c> if</c><00:22:01.560><c> I</c><00:22:01.680><c> did</c><00:22:01.860><c> that</c><00:22:02.100><c> would</c><00:22:02.340><c> that</c>

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
hard to know if I did that would that
 

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
hard to know if I did that would that
have<00:22:02.640><c> actually</c><00:22:02.850><c> been</c><00:22:02.880><c> worse</c><00:22:03.150><c> than</c><00:22:03.450><c> what</c>

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:03.570 align:start position:0%
have actually been worse than what
 

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.050 align:start position:0%
have actually been worse than what

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
scenario is we would build out separate
