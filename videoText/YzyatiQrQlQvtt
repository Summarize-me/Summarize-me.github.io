job<00:08:55.710><c> we</c><00:08:55.830><c> kind</c><00:08:55.980><c> of</c><00:08:56.070><c> assigned</c><00:08:56.370><c> him</c><00:08:56.550><c> and</c><00:08:57.050><c> he</c><00:08:58.050><c> had</c>

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
job we kind of assigned him and he had
 

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.340 align:start position:0%
job we kind of assigned him and he had
to<00:08:58.440><c> figure</c><00:08:59.010><c> it</c><00:08:59.250><c> out</c><00:09:00.320><c> really</c><00:09:01.320><c> like</c><00:09:01.970><c> on</c><00:09:02.970><c> the</c><00:09:03.149><c> fly</c>

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:03.350 align:start position:0%
to figure it out really like on the fly
 

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.190 align:start position:0%
to figure it out really like on the fly
and<00:09:04.350><c> so</c><00:09:04.649><c> he</c><00:09:05.279><c> ended</c><00:09:05.460><c> up</c><00:09:05.640><c> you</c><00:09:06.510><c> know</c><00:09:06.540><c> packing</c><00:09:07.050><c> this</c>

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so he ended up you know packing this
 

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.500 align:start position:0%
and so he ended up you know packing this
live<00:09:07.800><c> video</c><00:09:07.950><c> system</c><00:09:08.399><c> there</c><00:09:08.580><c> was</c><00:09:08.670><c> nothing</c><00:09:09.029><c> kind</c>

like no precedent right we basically
 

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
like no precedent right we basically
