00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 align:start position:0%
the only good generic startup advice is
 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.110 align:start position:0%
the only good generic startup advice is

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 align:start position:0%
should be Amazon's which is I'm gonna

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
charge as low of a price as possible so
 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.820 align:start position:0%
charge as low of a price as possible so
I<00:05:36.870><c> can</c><00:05:36.900><c> get</c><00:05:37.110><c> as</c><00:05:37.200><c> much</c><00:05:37.289><c> market</c><00:05:37.650><c> share</c><00:05:37.770><c> as</c>

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.750 align:start position:0%

you'd get to more market share if you
 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.580 align:start position:0%
you'd get to more market share if you

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 align:start position:0%
dominant companies and then that's the
 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.219 align:start position:0%
dominant companies and then that's the

actually I think that worked out really
well<00:09:55.339><c> for</c><00:09:55.610><c> them</c><00:09:55.759><c> and</c><00:09:55.939><c> similarly</c><00:09:56.660><c> Airbnb</c>

00:09:57.929 --> 00:09:57.939 align:start position:0%
well for them and similarly Airbnb
 

00:09:57.939 --> 00:10:00.100 align:start position:0%

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
for frugality and so that I think that
 

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.540 align:start position:0%
for frugality and so that I think that
was<00:10:26.329><c> a</c><00:10:26.360><c> very</c><00:10:26.569><c> smart</c><00:10:26.959><c> approach</c><00:10:27.949><c> by</c><00:10:28.130><c> them</c><00:10:28.339><c> to</c>

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.550 align:start position:0%
was a very smart approach by them to
 

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
was a very smart approach by them to
basically<00:10:28.939><c> say</c><00:10:29.060><c> hey</c><00:10:29.240><c> let's</c><00:10:29.420><c> take</c><00:10:29.569><c> something</c>

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:29.810 align:start position:0%

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:31.850 align:start position:0%
and turn it into a symbol of how we
 

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.069 align:start position:0%
and turn it into a symbol of how we

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
should act as a company so I thought
 

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:34.210 align:start position:0%
should act as a company so I thought
that<00:10:33.170><c> was</c><00:10:33.259><c> a</c><00:10:33.319><c> very</c><00:10:33.439><c> smart</c><00:10:33.620><c> cultural</c><00:10:33.980><c> move</c><00:10:34.130><c> by</c>

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:34.220 align:start position:0%
that was a very smart cultural move by

we've been in an eight-year bull market
yeah<00:11:30.140><c> so</c><00:11:30.290><c> obviously</c><00:11:30.649><c> companies</c><00:11:31.040><c> have</c><00:11:31.160><c> gone</c>

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
think most of it is too early and I do
think<00:12:17.959><c> it</c><00:12:18.019><c> will</c><00:12:18.079><c> eventually</c><00:12:18.470><c> happen</c><00:12:18.589><c> so</c><00:12:19.010><c> yeah</c>

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:19.329 align:start position:0%
think it will eventually happen so yeah
 

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:21.910 align:start position:0%
think it will eventually happen so yeah
I<00:12:20.329><c> think</c><00:12:20.839><c> the</c><00:12:21.050><c> other</c><00:12:21.199><c> area</c><00:12:21.380><c> is</c><00:12:21.529><c> actually</c><00:12:21.860><c> in</c>

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
I think the other area is actually in
 

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.460 align:start position:0%
I think the other area is actually in
crypto<00:12:22.250><c> so</c><00:12:22.610><c> I</c><00:12:23.060><c> actually</c><00:12:23.990><c> think</c><00:12:24.199><c> there's</c><00:12:24.410><c> a</c>

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:24.470 align:start position:0%

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.750 align:start position:0%

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.470 align:start position:0%
how you decentralize different services

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.090 align:start position:0%
fail and then in 10-15 years a new form
 

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.730 align:start position:0%
fail and then in 10-15 years a new form
of<00:13:30.210><c> that</c><00:13:30.330><c> idea</c><00:13:30.900><c> will</c><00:13:31.110><c> exist</c><00:13:31.470><c> and</c><00:13:31.620><c> be</c>

if you're in a highly regulated industry
you<00:38:53.090><c> may</c><00:38:53.210><c> want</c><00:38:53.390><c> to</c><00:38:53.510><c> add</c><00:38:53.750><c> that</c><00:38:53.840><c> person</c><00:38:54.050><c> quite</c>

first 50 people but if you're not in a
 

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.590 align:start position:0%
first 50 people but if you're not in a
highly<00:38:58.610><c> regulated</c><00:38:58.820><c> industry</c><00:38:59.330><c> maybe</c><00:38:59.480><c> you</c>

00:38:59.590 --> 00:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
highly regulated industry maybe you
 

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
highly regulated industry maybe you
don't<00:38:59.780><c> add</c><00:39:00.020><c> a</c><00:39:00.200><c> GC</c><00:39:00.650><c> until</c><00:39:01.010><c> you're</c><00:39:01.130><c> much</c><00:39:01.340><c> larger</c>

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:01.690 align:start position:0%
don't add a GC until you're much larger
 

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.210 align:start position:0%
don't add a GC until you're much larger
and<00:39:02.690><c> so</c><00:39:02.930><c> I</c><00:39:02.960><c> think</c><00:39:03.170><c> it</c><00:39:03.410><c> really</c><00:39:03.590><c> depends</c><00:39:03.920><c> a</c><00:39:04.070><c> bit</c>

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:04.220 align:start position:0%
and so I think it really depends a bit
 

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.870 align:start position:0%
and so I think it really depends a bit
when<00:39:04.790><c> all</c><00:39:04.970><c> is</c><00:39:05.150><c> said</c><00:39:05.180><c> it</c><00:39:05.510><c> done</c><00:39:06.760><c> you</c><00:39:07.760><c> know</c><00:39:07.790><c> I</c>

when all is said it done you know I
 

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.580 align:start position:0%
when all is said it done you know I

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:11.330 align:start position:0%
