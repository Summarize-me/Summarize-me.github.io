even<00:27:58.519><c> better</c><00:27:58.720><c> than</c><00:27:58.880><c> we</c>

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
even better than we
 

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.310 align:start position:0%
even better than we
do<00:28:01.120><c> and</c><00:28:01.240><c> so</c><00:28:01.640><c> within</c><00:28:02.000><c> 2</c><00:28:02.240><c> weeks</c><00:28:02.679><c> we</c><00:28:02.799><c> had</c><00:28:02.919><c> a</c><00:28:03.039><c> term</c>
