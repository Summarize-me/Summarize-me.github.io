00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.860 align:start position:0%
model many times and so I think it'd be
interesting<00:00:50.070><c> to</c><00:00:50.460><c> talk</c><00:00:50.579><c> about</c><00:00:50.700><c> that</c><00:00:50.940><c> and</c><00:00:51.300><c> then</c>

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 align:start position:0%
interesting to talk about that and then
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.770 align:start position:0%
interesting to talk about that and then
to<00:00:52.140><c> is</c><00:00:52.440><c> something</c><00:00:53.399><c> she's</c><00:00:53.579><c> an</c><00:00:53.730><c> expert</c><00:00:54.180><c> in</c><00:00:54.449><c> which</c>

to is something she's an expert in which
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.709 align:start position:0%
to is something she's an expert in which
is<00:00:54.930><c> grit</c><00:00:55.260><c> and</c><00:00:55.410><c> determination</c><00:00:55.860><c> I</c><00:00:56.730><c> think</c><00:00:57.570><c> she's</c>

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
is grit and determination I think she's
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.660 align:start position:0%
is grit and determination I think she's
one<00:00:57.870><c> of</c><00:00:57.960><c> the</c><00:00:58.109><c> few</c><00:00:58.920><c> people</c><00:00:59.070><c> that</c><00:00:59.430><c> I've</c><00:00:59.520><c> seen</c>

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 align:start position:0%
one of the few people that I've seen
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.139 align:start position:0%
one of the few people that I've seen
that<00:00:59.820><c> just</c><00:01:00.059><c> never</c><00:01:00.449><c> gives</c><00:01:00.809><c> up</c><00:01:00.989><c> and</c><00:01:01.949><c> so</c><00:01:02.340><c> I</c><00:01:02.820><c> think</c>

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 align:start position:0%
that just never gives up and so I think
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.690 align:start position:0%
that just never gives up and so I think
in<00:01:03.989><c> termination</c><00:01:04.860><c> or</c><00:01:04.949><c> one</c><00:01:05.070><c> the</c><00:01:05.159><c> qualities</c><00:01:05.489><c> many</c>

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
in termination or one the qualities many
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.460 align:start position:0%
in termination or one the qualities many
people<00:01:05.970><c> think</c><00:01:06.210><c> they</c><00:01:06.360><c> have</c><00:01:06.390><c> but</c><00:01:07.140><c> when</c>

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 align:start position:0%
people think they have but when
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.770 align:start position:0%
people think they have but when
hits<00:01:07.680><c> the</c><00:01:07.740><c> fan</c><00:01:08.030><c> things</c><00:01:09.030><c> start</c><00:01:09.240><c> to</c><00:01:09.299><c> fall</c><00:01:09.479><c> apart</c>

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
hits the fan things start to fall apart
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.990 align:start position:0%
hits the fan things start to fall apart
and<00:01:10.080><c> so</c><00:01:10.439><c> I</c><00:01:10.680><c> think</c><00:01:10.979><c> it's</c><00:01:11.250><c> also</c><00:01:11.430><c> interesting</c><00:01:11.729><c> to</c>

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's also interesting to
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's also interesting to
talk<00:01:12.150><c> about</c><00:01:12.330><c> so</c><00:01:12.960><c> with</c><00:01:13.080><c> that</c><00:01:13.200><c> I</c><00:01:13.500><c> would</c><00:01:13.619><c> love</c><00:01:13.860><c> to</c>
