00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
seemed to work out like what do you
 

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:02.949 align:start position:0%
seemed to work out like what do you
think<00:09:01.200><c> heart</c><00:09:01.519><c> what</c><00:09:01.680><c> was</c><00:09:01.839><c> the</c><00:09:01.920><c> play</c><00:09:02.080><c> there</c><00:09:02.720><c> yeah</c>

00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
think heart what was the play there yeah
 

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:05.350 align:start position:0%
think heart what was the play there yeah
i<00:09:03.040><c> think</c><00:09:03.680><c> slack</c><00:09:04.080><c> falls</c><00:09:04.480><c> under</c>

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think slack falls under
 

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.509 align:start position:0%
i think slack falls under
so<00:09:05.839><c> the</c><00:09:06.000><c> freemium</c><00:09:06.560><c> business</c><00:09:06.959><c> model</c><00:09:07.279><c> which</c><00:09:07.519><c> i</c>

00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
so the freemium business model which i
 

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:09.910 align:start position:0%
so the freemium business model which i
think<00:09:07.760><c> is</c><00:09:07.920><c> a</c><00:09:08.000><c> completely</c><00:09:08.880><c> legit</c><00:09:09.360><c> good</c><00:09:09.519><c> model</c>

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
think is a completely legit good model
 

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.750 align:start position:0%
think is a completely legit good model
right<00:09:10.080><c> like</c><00:09:10.240><c> the</c><00:09:10.320><c> idea</c><00:09:10.640><c> is</c><00:09:11.040><c> like</c><00:09:11.200><c> we</c><00:09:11.360><c> start</c><00:09:11.680><c> out</c>

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
right like the idea is like we start out
 

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.350 align:start position:0%
right like the idea is like we start out
with<00:09:11.920><c> a</c><00:09:12.000><c> basic</c><00:09:12.320><c> version</c><00:09:12.640><c> of</c><00:09:12.720><c> the</c><00:09:12.800><c> product</c><00:09:13.200><c> we</c>

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
with a basic version of the product we
 

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.110 align:start position:0%
with a basic version of the product we
make<00:09:13.600><c> it</c><00:09:13.920><c> free</c><00:09:14.720><c> we</c><00:09:14.880><c> get</c><00:09:15.040><c> people</c><00:09:15.360><c> using</c><00:09:15.760><c> it</c><00:09:16.320><c> um</c>

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
make it free we get people using it um
 

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.269 align:start position:0%
make it free we get people using it um
but<00:09:17.360><c> like</c><00:09:17.839><c> there's</c><00:09:18.160><c> two</c><00:09:18.480><c> things</c><00:09:19.040><c> that</c><00:09:19.200><c> are</c>

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
but like there's two things that are
 

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.630 align:start position:0%
