00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 align:start position:0%
create value for the world and in my
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350 align:start position:0%
create value for the world and in my
experience<00:00:37.920><c> if</c><00:00:38.160><c> you</c><00:00:38.309><c> don't</c><00:00:38.340><c> find</c><00:00:38.969><c> some</c><00:00:39.180><c> of</c><00:00:39.270><c> the</c>

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
experience if you don't find some of the
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
experience if you don't find some of the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 align:start position:0%
intersection of those three it's hard to
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
intersection of those three it's hard to
really<00:00:42.149><c> have</c><00:00:42.329><c> an</c><00:00:42.420><c> impact</c><00:00:42.510><c> I</c><00:00:42.960><c> think</c><00:00:43.140><c> most</c>

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 align:start position:0%
really have an impact I think most
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.709 align:start position:0%
really have an impact I think most
people<00:00:43.710><c> kind</c><00:00:43.980><c> of</c><00:00:44.100><c> just</c><00:00:44.309><c> fall</c><00:00:45.090><c> into</c><00:00:45.300><c> what</c><00:00:45.600><c> they</c>

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
people kind of just fall into what they
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.029 align:start position:0%
people kind of just fall into what they
work<00:00:45.899><c> on</c><00:00:46.050><c> they</c><00:00:46.260><c> don't</c><00:00:46.350><c> give</c><00:00:46.739><c> it</c><00:00:46.860><c> much</c><00:00:47.010><c> thought</c>

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
work on they don't give it much thought
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.910 align:start position:0%
work on they don't give it much thought
and<00:00:47.430><c> there</c><00:00:47.700><c> is</c><00:00:47.940><c> benefit</c><00:00:48.450><c> to</c><00:00:48.480><c> that</c><00:00:48.920><c> sometimes</c>

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
and there is benefit to that sometimes
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.220 align:start position:0%
and there is benefit to that sometimes
you<00:00:50.129><c> actually</c><00:00:50.280><c> have</c><00:00:50.460><c> to</c><00:00:50.670><c> just</c><00:00:50.820><c> try</c><00:00:51.059><c> stuff</c><00:00:51.230><c> to</c>

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 align:start position:0%
you actually have to just try stuff to
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.350 align:start position:0%
you actually have to just try stuff to
figure<00:00:52.469><c> out</c><00:00:52.559><c> what</c><00:00:52.649><c> you</c><00:00:52.739><c> like</c><00:00:52.920><c> but</c><00:00:53.670><c> I</c><00:00:53.879><c> really</c><00:00:53.910><c> do</c>

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 align:start position:0%

no perfect answer to that but it's

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
really challenging to even get that
approximately<00:05:55.840><c> correct</c><00:05:55.960><c> I</c><00:05:56.380><c> think</c><00:05:56.890><c> most</c>

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 align:start position:0%
approximately correct I think most
 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.820 align:start position:0%
approximately correct I think most
people<00:05:57.310><c> give</c><00:05:57.910><c> up</c><00:05:57.940><c> on</c><00:05:58.120><c> things</c><00:05:58.330><c> way</c><00:05:58.479><c> too</c><00:05:58.510><c> early</c>

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 align:start position:0%
people give up on things way too early
 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
people give up on things way too early
so<00:05:59.830><c> the</c><00:06:00.280><c> mistake</c><00:06:00.669><c> that</c><00:06:00.970><c> most</c><00:06:01.030><c> people</c><00:06:01.270><c> make</c><00:06:01.450><c> is</c>

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 align:start position:0%
so the mistake that most people make is
 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.870 align:start position:0%
so the mistake that most people make is

at this point yeah I just sort of like
there's<00:09:04.320><c> a</c><00:09:04.410><c> set</c><00:09:04.560><c> of</c><00:09:04.650><c> things</c><00:09:04.860><c> that</c><00:09:05.070><c> I</c><00:09:05.130><c> think</c><00:09:05.190><c> are</c>

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
there's a set of things that I think are
 

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
there's a set of things that I think are
important<00:09:07.680><c> and</c><00:09:08.210><c> I</c><00:09:09.210><c> want</c><00:09:09.510><c> to</c><00:09:09.570><c> work</c><00:09:09.660><c> on</c><00:09:09.750><c> this</c><00:09:09.990><c> I</c>

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.170 align:start position:0%
important and I want to work on this I
 

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.860 align:start position:0%
important and I want to work on this I
think<00:09:10.830><c> another</c><00:09:11.130><c> point</c><00:09:11.430><c> about</c><00:09:11.870><c> motivation</c>

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
think another point about motivation
 

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.810 align:start position:0%
think another point about motivation
that<00:09:13.170><c> is</c><00:09:13.230><c> that</c><00:09:14.070><c> people</c><00:09:14.340><c> don't</c><00:09:14.430><c> talk</c><00:09:14.580><c> about</c>

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
that is that people don't talk about
 

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.350 align:start position:0%
that is that people don't talk about
enough<00:09:15.060><c> is</c><00:09:15.960><c> related</c><00:09:16.500><c> to</c><00:09:16.530><c> burnout</c><00:09:16.890><c> so</c><00:09:17.520><c> I</c><00:09:17.820><c> was</c>

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
enough is related to burnout so I was
 

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
enough is related to burnout so I was
told<00:09:18.600><c> and</c><00:09:18.870><c> I</c><00:09:18.990><c> thought</c><00:09:19.170><c> for</c><00:09:19.380><c> a</c><00:09:19.410><c> long</c><00:09:19.590><c> time</c><00:09:19.800><c> that</c>

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.010 align:start position:0%
told and I thought for a long time that
 

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.580 align:start position:0%
told and I thought for a long time that
you<00:09:20.160><c> get</c><00:09:20.280><c> burned</c><00:09:20.520><c> out</c><00:09:20.640><c> from</c><00:09:20.790><c> working</c><00:09:21.030><c> too</c><00:09:21.120><c> hard</c>

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:21.590 align:start position:0%
you get burned out from working too hard
 

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.470 align:start position:0%
you get burned out from working too hard
and<00:09:22.590><c> at</c><00:09:23.190><c> least</c><00:09:23.490><c> in</c><00:09:23.580><c> my</c><00:09:23.670><c> own</c><00:09:23.700><c> experience</c><00:09:24.270><c> what</c><00:09:24.450><c> I</c>

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
and at least in my own experience what I
 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.390 align:start position:0%
and at least in my own experience what I
found<00:09:24.690><c> is</c><00:09:24.960><c> that</c><00:09:25.170><c> burnout</c><00:09:25.740><c> actually</c><00:09:26.130><c> comes</c>

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
found is that burnout actually comes
 

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.270 align:start position:0%
found is that burnout actually comes
from<00:09:27.350><c> failing</c><00:09:28.350><c> and</c><00:09:28.620><c> things</c><00:09:28.950><c> not</c><00:09:29.070><c> working</c>

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:29.280 align:start position:0%

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
that I have infinite energy to work on
 

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.420 align:start position:0%
that I have infinite energy to work on
