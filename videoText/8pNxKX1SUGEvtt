let's<00:01:54.479><c> talk</c><00:01:54.720><c> about</c><00:01:55.600><c> why</c><00:01:55.840><c> you</c><00:01:56.000><c> should</c><00:01:56.240><c> pivot</c>

let's talk about why you should pivot

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
so the main reason i would argue is
 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.550 align:start position:0%
so the main reason i would argue is
opportunity<00:01:59.759><c> cost</c>

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity cost

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
is that

better<00:02:37.360><c> you</c><00:02:37.519><c> should</c><00:02:37.680><c> pivot</c>

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
better you should pivot
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.550 align:start position:0%
better you should pivot
and<00:02:38.319><c> so</c><00:02:38.720><c> the</c><00:02:38.959><c> key</c><00:02:39.200><c> thing</c><00:02:39.440><c> to</c><00:02:39.840><c> if</c><00:02:40.000><c> you</c><00:02:40.160><c> like</c><00:02:40.400><c> look</c>

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
and so the key thing to if you like look
 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.910 align:start position:0%
and so the key thing to if you like look
at<00:02:40.640><c> this</c><00:02:40.800><c> equation</c><00:02:41.200><c> like</c><00:02:41.360><c> what</c><00:02:41.519><c> am</c><00:02:41.680><c> i</c><00:02:41.760><c> really</c>

reason<00:09:27.600><c> to</c><00:09:27.680><c> pivot</c><00:09:28.080><c> is</c><00:09:28.240><c> you</c><00:09:28.399><c> get</c><00:09:28.560><c> another</c><00:09:29.040><c> roll</c>

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
reason to pivot is you get another roll
 

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:31.190 align:start position:0%
reason to pivot is you get another roll

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
and so i've just seen people that use
 

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.110 align:start position:0%
and so i've just seen people that use
these<00:09:33.680><c> opportunities</c><00:09:34.240><c> really</c><00:09:34.480><c> well</c>

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
these opportunities really well
 

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.550 align:start position:0%
these opportunities really well
it's<00:09:35.279><c> much</c><00:09:35.519><c> easier</c><00:09:35.760><c> to</c><00:09:35.839><c> be</c><00:09:36.000><c> lucky</c><00:09:36.320><c> when</c><00:09:36.480><c> you</c>

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's much easier to be lucky when you
 

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.470 align:start position:0%
it's much easier to be lucky when you
get<00:09:36.800><c> like</c><00:09:37.040><c> half</c><00:09:37.279><c> a</c><00:09:37.360><c> dozen</c><00:09:37.680><c> shots</c><00:09:37.920><c> on</c><00:09:38.080><c> goal</c><00:09:38.240><c> than</c>

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
get like half a dozen shots on goal than
 

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.110 align:start position:0%
get like half a dozen shots on goal than
one

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:42.389 align:start position:0%
right and so just if we're just playing

you<00:16:51.519><c> a</c><00:16:51.920><c> few</c>

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
you a few
 

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.749 align:start position:0%
you a few
criteria<00:16:53.120><c> to</c><00:16:53.360><c> evaluate</c><00:16:54.000><c> an</c><00:16:54.160><c> idea</c><00:16:55.120><c> okay</c>

00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
criteria to evaluate an idea okay
 

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:58.069 align:start position:0%
criteria to evaluate an idea okay
and<00:16:55.920><c> so</c><00:16:56.320><c> what</c><00:16:56.480><c> i</c><00:16:56.560><c> did</c><00:16:56.720><c> is</c><00:16:56.880><c> there's</c><00:16:57.600><c> you</c><00:16:57.680><c> know</c>

00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
and so what i did is there's you know
 

00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.590 align:start position:0%
and so what i did is there's you know
four<00:16:58.399><c> key</c><00:16:58.639><c> things</c><00:16:58.880><c> that</c><00:16:59.040><c> i</c><00:16:59.120><c> think</c><00:16:59.360><c> you</c><00:16:59.440><c> could</c>

00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
four key things that i think you could
 

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.990 align:start position:0%
four key things that i think you could
use<00:16:59.839><c> to</c><00:17:00.000><c> evaluate</c><00:17:00.560><c> the</c><00:17:00.720><c> quality</c><00:17:01.040><c> of</c><00:17:01.120><c> an</c><00:17:01.279><c> idea</c>

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
use to evaluate the quality of an idea
 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.350 align:start position:0%
use to evaluate the quality of an idea
and<00:17:02.079><c> you</c><00:17:02.240><c> could</c><00:17:02.320><c> give</c><00:17:02.480><c> them</c><00:17:02.639><c> a</c><00:17:02.720><c> one</c><00:17:02.880><c> to</c><00:17:03.040><c> ten</c><00:17:03.199><c> and</c>

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
and you could give them a one to ten and
 

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.549 align:start position:0%
and you could give them a one to ten and
then<00:17:03.440><c> you</c><00:17:03.519><c> average</c><00:17:03.839><c> those</c><00:17:04.000><c> together</c><00:17:04.319><c> to</c><00:17:04.480><c> give</c>

00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
then you average those together to give
 

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:05.909 align:start position:0%
then you average those together to give
an<00:17:04.720><c> overall</c><00:17:05.039><c> quality</c><00:17:05.360><c> score</c>

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
an overall quality score
 

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:07.750 align:start position:0%
an overall quality score
okay<00:17:06.559><c> so</c><00:17:06.720><c> let</c><00:17:06.799><c> me</c><00:17:06.880><c> just</c><00:17:07.039><c> go</c><00:17:07.199><c> into</c><00:17:07.439><c> detail</c><00:17:07.679><c> on</c>

you<00:22:06.240><c> know</c><00:22:07.280><c> early</c><00:22:07.520><c> market</c><00:22:07.760><c> feedback</c><00:22:08.080><c> though</c>

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know early market feedback though
 

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.510 align:start position:0%
you know early market feedback though
was<00:22:08.320><c> only</c><00:22:08.480><c> three</c><00:22:08.720><c> out</c><00:22:08.799><c> of</c><00:22:08.880><c> ten</c><00:22:09.039><c> and</c><00:22:09.120><c> the</c><00:22:09.200><c> reason</c>

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
was only three out of ten and the reason
 

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.390 align:start position:0%
was only three out of ten and the reason
is

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
is
 

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.750 align:start position:0%
is
no<00:22:10.559><c> one</c><00:22:10.799><c> wanted</c><00:22:11.039><c> to</c><00:22:11.200><c> pay</c><00:22:11.440><c> and</c><00:22:11.520><c> they</c><00:22:11.600><c> were</c>

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
no one wanted to pay and they were
 

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.350 align:start position:0%
no one wanted to pay and they were
losing<00:22:12.000><c> money</c><00:22:12.240><c> on</c><00:22:12.320><c> every</c><00:22:12.480><c> transaction</c><00:22:13.200><c> so</c>

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
losing money on every transaction so
 

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.549 align:start position:0%
losing money on every transaction so
there's<00:22:13.520><c> all</c><00:22:13.600><c> these</c><00:22:13.760><c> reasons</c><00:22:14.080><c> this</c><00:22:14.320><c> wasn't</c>

00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
there's all these reasons this wasn't
 

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:15.350 align:start position:0%
there's all these reasons this wasn't
really<00:22:14.799><c> working</c>

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
really working
 

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.190 align:start position:0%
really working
and<00:22:15.520><c> so</c><00:22:16.000><c> they</c><00:22:16.159><c> decided</c><00:22:16.480><c> to</c><00:22:16.559><c> pivot</c><00:22:16.880><c> even</c><00:22:17.039><c> though</c>

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
and so they decided to pivot even though
 

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.870 align:start position:0%
and so they decided to pivot even though
this<00:22:17.360><c> is</c><00:22:17.440><c> an</c><00:22:17.600><c> example</c><00:22:18.000><c> of</c>

and<00:23:47.600><c> then</c><00:23:47.840><c> the</c><00:23:47.919><c> early</c><00:23:48.159><c> market</c><00:23:48.400><c> feedback</c><00:23:48.960><c> was</c>

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then the early market feedback was
 

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.269 align:start position:0%
and then the early market feedback was

00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
like not good everyone was really polite
 

00:23:51.279 --> 00:23:52.710 align:start position:0%

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
and no one used the dang thing like
 

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.549 align:start position:0%
and no one used the dang thing like
their<00:23:52.880><c> usage</c><00:23:53.200><c> was</c><00:23:53.360><c> just</c><00:23:53.600><c> horrible</c>

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
their usage was just horrible
 

00:23:54.559 --> 00:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
their usage was just horrible
so<00:23:55.120><c> this</c><00:23:55.279><c> one</c><00:23:55.520><c> was</c><00:23:55.679><c> again</c><00:23:55.919><c> was</c><00:23:56.080><c> kind</c><00:23:56.240><c> of</c>

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
so this one was again was kind of
 

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.669 align:start position:0%
so this one was again was kind of
