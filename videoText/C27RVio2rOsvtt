and<00:02:34.350><c> so</c><00:02:35.190><c> I</c><00:02:35.220><c> think</c><00:02:35.340><c> at</c><00:02:35.550><c> various</c><00:02:35.970><c> points</c><00:02:36.390><c> during</c>

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
and so I think at various points during
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.970 align:start position:0%
and so I think at various points during
the<00:02:36.660><c> company</c><00:02:37.110><c> when</c><00:02:37.350><c> it</c><00:02:37.380><c> looked</c><00:02:37.650><c> like</c><00:02:37.770><c> we</c><00:02:37.890><c> would</c>

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
the company when it looked like we would
 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.910 align:start position:0%
the company when it looked like we would
fail<00:02:38.480><c> basically</c><00:02:39.480><c> our</c><00:02:39.810><c> startup</c><00:02:40.410><c> failing</c><00:02:40.740><c> was</c>

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
fail basically our startup failing was
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.250 align:start position:0%
fail basically our startup failing was
our<00:02:41.040><c> life</c><00:02:41.310><c> failing</c><00:02:41.790><c> right</c><00:02:42.720><c> it</c><00:02:42.840><c> was</c><00:02:42.930><c> like</c><00:02:43.080><c> well</c>

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
our life failing right it was like well
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
our life failing right it was like well
this<00:02:43.410><c> is</c><00:02:43.530><c> the</c><00:02:43.590><c> only</c><00:02:43.740><c> thing</c><00:02:43.980><c> you've</c><00:02:44.160><c> done</c><00:02:44.370><c> so</c>

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 align:start position:0%
this is the only thing you've done so
 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.150 align:start position:0%
this is the only thing you've done so
far<00:02:44.640><c> and</c><00:02:45.150><c> so</c><00:02:45.270><c> if</c><00:02:45.390><c> it</c><00:02:45.510><c> fails</c><00:02:45.780><c> you</c><00:02:46.200><c> get</c><00:02:46.380><c> F</c><00:02:46.650><c> on</c><00:02:46.890><c> life</c>

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
far and so if it fails you get F on life
 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
far and so if it fails you get F on life
and<00:02:48.110><c> I</c><00:02:49.110><c> think</c><00:02:49.530><c> that</c><00:02:49.710><c> we</c><00:02:49.830><c> all</c><00:02:50.040><c> had</c><00:02:50.340><c> that</c><00:02:50.550><c> feeling</c>

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 align:start position:0%
and I think that we all had that feeling
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.050 align:start position:0%
and I think that we all had that feeling
very<00:02:51.300><c> internally</c><00:02:51.990><c> and</c><00:02:52.790><c> therefore</c><00:02:53.790><c> we</c><00:02:53.880><c> just</c>

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
very internally and therefore we just
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.540 align:start position:0%
very internally and therefore we just
couldn't<00:02:54.360><c> really</c><00:02:54.480><c> conceive</c><00:02:55.020><c> of</c><00:02:55.050><c> giving</c><00:02:55.560><c> up</c><00:02:55.740><c> so</c>

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 align:start position:0%
couldn't really conceive of giving up so
 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.070 align:start position:0%
couldn't really conceive of giving up so
I<00:02:56.580><c> think</c><00:02:56.700><c> more</c><00:02:57.240><c> than</c><00:02:57.360><c> anything</c><00:02:57.570><c> I</c><00:02:57.750><c> want</c><00:02:57.900><c> to</c><00:02:57.960><c> say</c>

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
I think more than anything I want to say
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.990 align:start position:0%
I think more than anything I want to say
in<00:02:58.140><c> the</c><00:02:58.230><c> rest</c><00:02:58.380><c> is</c><00:02:58.500><c> presentation</c><00:02:59.040><c> those</c><00:02:59.760><c> were</c>

thought we contributed to da use was
 

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
thought we contributed to da use was

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
new content created those three things
 

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
new content created those three things
so<00:37:46.450><c> every</c><00:37:46.750><c> cycle</c><00:37:47.080><c> we</c><00:37:47.109><c> ran</c><00:37:47.380><c> one</c><00:37:47.859><c> of</c><00:37:48.010><c> those</c><00:37:48.190><c> three</c>

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:48.670 align:start position:0%
so every cycle we ran one of those three
 

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.730 align:start position:0%
so every cycle we ran one of those three
numbers<00:37:49.150><c> moving</c><00:37:49.900><c> that</c><00:37:50.020><c> number</c><00:37:50.200><c> so</c><00:37:50.560><c> that</c><00:37:50.590><c> the</c>
