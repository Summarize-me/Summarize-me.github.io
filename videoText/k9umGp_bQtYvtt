00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
first thing you should do is build a
 

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.270 align:start position:0%
first thing you should do is build a
product<00:10:04.230><c> that</c><00:10:04.320><c> people</c><00:10:04.470><c> really</c><00:10:04.890><c> really</c><00:10:05.070><c> love</c>

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
and so that could be defined as you know
 

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
and so that could be defined as you know
that<00:10:08.760><c> Wow</c><00:10:09.090><c> so</c><00:10:09.570><c> so</c><00:10:09.950><c> then</c><00:10:10.950><c> I</c><00:10:11.070><c> would</c><00:10:11.130><c> say</c><00:10:11.460><c> the</c>

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:11.850 align:start position:0%
that Wow so so then I would say the
 

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.310 align:start position:0%
that Wow so so then I would say the
question<00:10:12.000><c> is</c><00:10:12.300><c> what</c><00:10:12.660><c> are</c><00:10:12.750><c> the</c><00:10:12.840><c> metrics</c><00:10:12.990><c> that</c>

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
question is what are the metrics that
 

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
question is what are the metrics that
define<00:10:13.620><c> what</c><00:10:13.800><c> happy</c><00:10:14.070><c> engaged</c><00:10:14.370><c> users</c><00:10:14.790><c> are</c>

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.090 align:start position:0%
define what happy engaged users are
 

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.940 align:start position:0%
define what happy engaged users are

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:18.930 align:start position:0%
value out of the product and so it's
 

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:20.750 align:start position:0%
value out of the product and so it's
it's<00:10:19.290><c> different</c><00:10:19.590><c> for</c><00:10:19.770><c> every</c><00:10:19.980><c> single</c><00:10:20.370><c> company</c>

four key metrics that kind of give you a

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.580 align:start position:0%
360 over overview of what that means so
it<00:10:27.900><c> could</c><00:10:28.020><c> be</c><00:10:28.050><c> like</c><00:10:28.290><c> weekly</c><00:10:29.280><c> active</c><00:10:29.580><c> users</c><00:10:29.880><c> MPs</c>

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:41.850 align:start position:0%

to<00:10:41.910><c> look</c><00:10:42.120><c> at</c><00:10:42.240><c> and</c><00:10:42.420><c> so</c><00:10:42.540><c> we</c><00:10:42.660><c> would</c><00:10:42.780><c> always</c>

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
to look at and so we would always
 

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.230 align:start position:0%
to look at and so we would always
probably<00:10:43.650><c> ask</c><00:10:43.950><c> for</c><00:10:44.220><c> those</c><00:10:44.610><c> kind</c><00:10:44.820><c> of</c><00:10:44.880><c> metrics</c>

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
probably ask for those kind of metrics
 

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.990 align:start position:0%
probably ask for those kind of metrics
and<00:10:46.200><c> then</c><00:10:46.620><c> the</c><00:10:47.010><c> more</c><00:10:47.160><c> qualitative</c><00:10:47.700><c> is</c><00:10:47.820><c> like</c>

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then the more qualitative is like
 

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then the more qualitative is like

so<00:20:21.269><c> I</c><00:20:21.659><c> guess</c><00:20:21.960><c> of</c><00:20:22.289><c> of</c><00:20:22.950><c> the</c><00:20:23.519><c> women</c><00:20:23.850><c> that</c><00:20:23.879><c> have</c>

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
so I guess of of the women that have
 

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.769 align:start position:0%
so I guess of of the women that have
come<00:20:24.539><c> in</c><00:20:25.460><c> and</c><00:20:26.460><c> the</c><00:20:26.609><c> women</c><00:20:26.850><c> that</c><00:20:26.970><c> we</c><00:20:27.059><c> have</c><00:20:27.389><c> taste</c>

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:27.779 align:start position:0%
come in and the women that we have taste
 

00:20:27.779 --> 00:20:30.470 align:start position:0%
