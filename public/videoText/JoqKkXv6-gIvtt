um<00:00:29.679><c> uh</c><00:00:30.199><c> I</c><00:00:30.279><c> wanted</c><00:00:30.519><c> to</c><00:00:30.720><c> first</c><00:00:30.960><c> start</c><00:00:31.240><c> by</c><00:00:31.439><c> asking</c>

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 align:start position:0%
um uh I wanted to first start by asking
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.709 align:start position:0%
um uh I wanted to first start by asking
you<00:00:31.800><c> a</c><00:00:31.960><c> question</c><00:00:32.680><c> um</c><00:00:32.880><c> does</c><00:00:33.040><c> anybody</c><00:00:33.399><c> know</c><00:00:33.600><c> what</c>

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
you a question um does anybody know what
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.549 align:start position:0%
you a question um does anybody know what
the<00:00:33.840><c> most</c><00:00:34.079><c> complicated</c><00:00:34.600><c> piece</c><00:00:34.760><c> of</c><00:00:34.960><c> technology</c>

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 align:start position:0%
the most complicated piece of technology
 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.790 align:start position:0%
the most complicated piece of technology
on<00:00:35.800><c> this</c><00:00:36.000><c> desk</c>

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.830 align:start position:0%
 
is<00:00:40.800><c> you're</c><00:00:41.039><c> right</c><00:00:41.200><c> it's</c><00:00:41.360><c> the</c><00:00:41.879><c> plant</c><00:00:43.160><c> right</c><00:00:44.160><c> uh</c>

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
is you're right it's the plant right uh
 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.430 align:start position:0%
is you're right it's the plant right uh
so<00:00:45.120><c> if</c><00:00:45.200><c> you</c><00:00:45.320><c> think</c><00:00:45.520><c> about</c><00:00:45.719><c> it</c><00:00:46.120><c> right</c><00:00:46.280><c> this</c>

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
so if you think about it right this
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.029 align:start position:0%
so if you think about it right this
plant<00:00:46.719><c> is</c><00:00:46.920><c> capable</c><00:00:47.239><c> of</c>

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
it makes its own shape itself um and it
 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.670 align:start position:0%
it makes its own shape itself um and it

of but biology has it all inherently and
this<00:01:06.520><c> is</c><00:01:06.760><c> what</c><00:01:07.000><c> makes</c><00:01:07.280><c> me</c><00:01:07.439><c> so</c><00:01:07.680><c> in</c><00:01:07.840><c> love</c><00:01:08.040><c> with</c>

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
this is what makes me so in love with

this is what makes me so in love with
Biology<00:01:08.880><c> right</c><00:01:09.040><c> is</c><00:01:09.159><c> that</c><00:01:09.320><c> it's</c><00:01:09.520><c> capable</c><00:01:09.880><c> of</c>

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
Biology right is that it's capable of

all these things um so in my mind
 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.469 align:start position:0%
all these things um so in my mind
biology<00:01:13.680><c> is</c><00:01:13.799><c> the</c><00:01:13.880><c> most</c><00:01:14.080><c> powerful</c>

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 align:start position:0%

that this next century is going to be uh
the<00:01:28.439><c> place</c><00:01:28.720><c> where</c><00:01:28.960><c> we</c><00:01:29.119><c> learn</c><00:01:29.439><c> how</c><00:01:29.560><c> to</c><00:01:29.960><c> design</c>

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 align:start position:0%

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
did what we had had to do with the money
 

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.509 align:start position:0%
did what we had had to do with the money
we<00:14:30.680><c> had</c><00:14:30.839><c> available</c><00:14:31.199><c> to</c><00:14:31.399><c> us</c><00:14:31.839><c> right</c><00:14:32.639><c> um</c><00:14:33.639><c> and</c><00:14:33.839><c> so</c>

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:34.519 align:start position:0%
we had available to us right um and so
 

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
we had available to us right um and so

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
so this is how we got started and for
 

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.590 align:start position:0%
so this is how we got started and for

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.549 align:start position:0%
companies um so if we can make gko a
place<00:22:36.799><c> where</c><00:22:37.080><c> these</c><00:22:37.240><c> folks</c><00:22:37.480><c> want</c><00:22:37.600><c> to</c><00:22:37.799><c> work</c>

place where these folks want to work
 

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:40.230 align:start position:0%
place where these folks want to work
then<00:22:38.720><c> that's</c><00:22:38.880><c> a</c><00:22:39.000><c> Competitive</c><00:22:39.520><c> Edge</c><00:22:39.880><c> relative</c>

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
then that's a Competitive Edge relative
 

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.390 align:start position:0%
then that's a Competitive Edge relative
to<00:22:40.799><c> um</c><00:22:41.000><c> other</c><00:22:41.520><c> other</c><00:22:41.840><c> companies</c><00:22:42.840><c> right</c><00:22:43.080><c> and</c><00:22:43.400><c> so</c>

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
to um other other companies right and so
 

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.190 align:start position:0%
to um other other companies right and so
I<00:22:44.520><c> don't</c><00:22:44.679><c> have</c><00:22:44.840><c> much</c><00:22:45.000><c> more</c><00:22:45.200><c> for</c><00:22:45.440><c> you</c><00:22:45.600><c> than</c><00:22:45.840><c> this</c>

00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
by thinking about it early um when we're
 

00:22:57.159 --> 00:22:58.830 align:start position:0%
by thinking about it early um when we're
when<00:22:57.559><c> frankly</c><00:22:57.919><c> just</c><00:22:58.039><c> a</c><00:22:58.159><c> small</c><00:22:58.559><c> number</c><00:22:58.720><c> of</c>

when frankly just a small number of
 

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.110 align:start position:0%
when frankly just a small number of

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
hires can radically change our stats
 

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
hires can radically change our stats
maybe<00:23:01.360><c> we</c><00:23:01.440><c> can</c><00:23:01.600><c> do</c><00:23:01.720><c> something</c><00:23:02.039><c> about</c><00:23:02.400><c> this</c><00:23:03.080><c> um</c>

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do something about this um
 

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.269 align:start position:0%
maybe we can do something about this um
uh<00:23:04.400><c> now</c><00:23:04.880><c> rather</c><00:23:05.120><c> than</c><00:23:05.720><c> later</c><00:23:06.720><c> and</c><00:23:06.840><c> maybe</c><00:23:07.080><c> it'll</c>

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh now rather than later and maybe it'll
 

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:10.789 align:start position:0%
uh now rather than later and maybe it'll
even<00:23:07.440><c> give</c><00:23:07.559><c> us</c><00:23:07.679><c> a</c><00:23:07.799><c> Competitive</c><00:23:08.480><c> Edge</c><00:23:09.600><c> um</c><00:23:10.600><c> one</c>

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
even give us a Competitive Edge um one
 

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.110 align:start position:0%
even give us a Competitive Edge um one
thing<00:23:10.960><c> that's</c><00:23:11.159><c> been</c><00:23:11.279><c> a</c><00:23:11.360><c> little</c><00:23:11.600><c> promising</c><00:23:11.960><c> to</c>
