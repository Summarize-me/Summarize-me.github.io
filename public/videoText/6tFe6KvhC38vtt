00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 align:start position:0%
is that every single one of us started
 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.149 align:start position:0%
is that every single one of us started

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%

actually deciding who should had product
was<00:04:39.400><c> to</c><00:04:39.760><c> allow</c><00:04:40.330><c> the</c><00:04:40.390><c> user</c><00:04:40.750><c> to</c><00:04:40.870><c> select</c>

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 align:start position:0%
was to allow the user to select
 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:54.090 align:start position:0%
was to allow the user to select

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 align:start position:0%
different background yeah and that's
 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.190 align:start position:0%

business business stuff yes and you had
I<00:08:04.150><c> think</c><00:08:04.180><c> probably</c><00:08:04.540><c> the</c><00:08:04.780><c> personality</c><00:08:05.410><c> to</c>

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
I think probably the personality to
 

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.950 align:start position:0%
I think probably the personality to
match<00:08:05.710><c> up</c><00:08:05.950><c> very</c><00:08:06.480><c> exactly</c><00:08:07.480><c> and</c><00:08:07.660><c> awkward</c><00:08:07.900><c> they</c>

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
match up very exactly and awkward they
 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.210 align:start position:0%
match up very exactly and awkward they
had<00:08:08.050><c> never</c><00:08:08.140><c> built</c><00:08:08.410><c> product</c><00:08:08.740><c> before</c><00:08:08.890><c> ever</c>

think there was probably a time in the

so<00:27:18.510><c> I</c><00:27:18.960><c> had</c><00:27:19.080><c> this</c><00:27:19.230><c> really</c><00:27:19.370><c> awkward</c><00:27:20.370><c> like</c><00:27:20.850><c> where</c>

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:21.510 align:start position:0%
so I had this really awkward like where
 

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.330 align:start position:0%
so I had this really awkward like where
I<00:27:21.539><c> tried</c><00:27:21.840><c> to</c><00:27:21.990><c> almost</c><00:27:22.320><c> make</c><00:27:22.559><c> it</c><00:27:22.740><c> so</c><00:27:22.890><c> that</c><00:27:22.919><c> they</c>

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
I tried to almost make it so that they
 

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.639 align:start position:0%
I tried to almost make it so that they
would<00:27:23.610><c> come</c><00:27:23.880><c> to</c><00:27:24.090><c> that</c><00:27:24.270><c> conclusion</c><00:27:24.649><c> themselves</c>

00:27:25.639 --> 00:27:25.649 align:start position:0%
would come to that conclusion themselves
 

00:27:25.649 --> 00:27:30.500 align:start position:0%
would come to that conclusion themselves
which<00:27:25.770><c> is</c><00:27:25.919><c> really</c><00:27:26.159><c> stupid</c><00:27:29.149><c> it's</c><00:27:30.149><c> really</c>

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:30.510 align:start position:0%
which is really stupid it's really
 

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.909 align:start position:0%
which is really stupid it's really
dangerous<00:27:30.600><c> well</c><00:27:31.049><c> but</c><00:27:31.260><c> that's</c><00:27:31.409><c> the</c><00:27:31.559><c> next</c><00:27:31.740><c> thing</c>

00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
dangerous well but that's the next thing
 

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:33.110 align:start position:0%
dangerous well but that's the next thing
we<00:27:32.070><c> wanted</c><00:27:32.309><c> to</c><00:27:32.399><c> talk</c><00:27:32.549><c> about</c><00:27:32.580><c> so</c><00:27:32.940><c> that's</c><00:27:33.029><c> a</c>

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
we wanted to talk about so that's a
 

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.460 align:start position:0%
we wanted to talk about so that's a
performance<00:27:33.419><c> right</c><00:27:33.809><c> yeah</c><00:27:34.140><c> there</c><00:27:34.470><c> you</c><00:27:34.590><c> go</c><00:27:36.440><c> yeah</c>

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:37.470 align:start position:0%
performance right yeah there you go yeah
 

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.220 align:start position:0%
performance right yeah there you go yeah
so<00:27:37.770><c> symptoms</c><00:27:38.460><c> of</c><00:27:38.700><c> feeling</c><00:27:39.480><c> that</c><00:27:39.630><c> someone's</c>

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:40.230 align:start position:0%
so symptoms of feeling that someone's
 

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.330 align:start position:0%
so symptoms of feeling that someone's
underperforming<00:27:41.899><c> yes</c><00:27:42.899><c> I</c><00:27:43.380><c> have</c><00:27:43.919><c> been</c><00:27:44.070><c> thinking</c>

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
underperforming yes I have been thinking
 

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
underperforming yes I have been thinking
about<00:27:44.640><c> this</c><00:27:44.909><c> actually</c><00:27:45.210><c> so</c><00:27:45.929><c> I</c><00:27:46.549><c> have</c><00:27:47.549><c> come</c><00:27:48.390><c> to</c>

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
about this actually so I have come to
 

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.860 align:start position:0%
about this actually so I have come to
the<00:27:48.570><c> conclusion</c><00:27:48.690><c> that</c><00:27:49.020><c> in</c><00:27:49.590><c> my</c><00:27:49.860><c> clients</c><00:27:50.490><c> who</c>

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:13.770 align:start position:0%
out that is a real problem and so that's
 

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
out that is a real problem and so that's
one<00:28:14.039><c> bucket</c><00:28:14.340><c> and</c><00:28:14.520><c> then</c><00:28:14.610><c> the</c><00:28:14.730><c> other</c><00:28:14.880><c> bucket</c><00:28:15.120><c> are</c>

one bucket and then the other bucket are
 

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.380 align:start position:0%
one bucket and then the other bucket are

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.710 align:start position:0%
would be explicit and say as of date
which<00:45:32.370><c> I</c><00:45:32.490><c> would</c><00:45:32.640><c> said</c><00:45:32.820><c> an</c><00:45:32.910><c> advanced</c><00:45:33.150><c> podcast</c>

which I would said an advanced podcast
 

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.660 align:start position:0%
which I would said an advanced podcast
is<00:45:33.930><c> dead</c><00:45:34.140><c> but</c><00:45:34.620><c> say</c><00:45:34.740><c> that</c><00:45:34.770><c> in</c><00:45:34.980><c> much</c><00:45:35.130><c> nicer</c><00:45:35.460><c> words</c>

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:35.670 align:start position:0%
is dead but say that in much nicer words
 

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:38.590 align:start position:0%
is dead but say that in much nicer words
so<00:45:36.090><c> then</c><00:45:36.570><c> really</c><00:45:36.960><c> that</c><00:45:36.990><c> structure</c><00:45:37.680><c> is</c><00:45:37.980><c> a</c>

so then really that structure is a
 

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.500 align:start position:0%
so then really that structure is a
