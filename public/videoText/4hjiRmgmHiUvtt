really risky maneuver and I would advise

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
that 80 or 90% uh gross margin so the
 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:29.990 align:start position:0%
that 80 or 90% uh gross margin so the

third element in pricing is competition

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
so you've done your value equation
 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.430 align:start position:0%
so you've done your value equation
you've<00:06:31.720><c> calculated</c><00:06:32.360><c> about</c><00:06:32.520><c> a</c><00:06:32.639><c> third</c><00:06:32.880><c> of</c><00:06:33.080><c> that</c>

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
you've calculated about a third of that
 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.189 align:start position:0%
you've calculated about a third of that
you've<00:06:33.639><c> checked</c><00:06:33.880><c> that</c><00:06:34.000><c> your</c><00:06:34.160><c> costs</c><00:06:34.479><c> are</c><00:06:35.000><c> way</c>

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
you've checked that your costs are way

you've checked that your costs are way
way<00:06:35.360><c> below</c><00:06:35.639><c> that</c><00:06:35.800><c> so</c><00:06:35.919><c> you're</c><00:06:36.080><c> sustaining</c><00:06:36.479><c> a</c>

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
