00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.989 align:start position:0%
so get the people right in the culture
will<00:16:36.769><c> follow</c><00:16:36.980><c> that's</c><00:16:37.459><c> not</c><00:16:37.699><c> the</c><00:16:37.790><c> other</c><00:16:37.879><c> way</c>

00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:37.999 align:start position:0%
will follow that's not the other way
 

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:42.670 align:start position:0%
will follow that's not the other way
around<00:16:38.559><c> and</c><00:16:39.559><c> so</c><00:16:40.279><c> I</c><00:16:40.759><c> mean</c><00:16:41.230><c> Brian</c><00:16:42.230><c> 8</c><00:16:42.410><c> and</c><00:16:42.499><c> I</c><00:16:42.529><c> were</c>

since such an early stage like I don't I
 

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
since such an early stage like I don't I
don't<00:21:11.770><c> think</c><00:21:11.890><c> we</c><00:21:11.950><c> had</c><00:21:12.070><c> quite</c><00:21:12.610><c> hit</c><00:21:12.790><c> the</c><00:21:12.820><c> hockey</c>

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:41.770 align:start position:0%
multiple stars thing which is you go to

if we were design the perfect experience

if we were design the perfect experience

and everything would be perfect what
 

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.650 align:start position:0%
and everything would be perfect what

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:46.660 align:start position:0%
would that be that's clearly not

would that be that's clearly not

had always been more of a con

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.020 align:start position:0%
like start here and yes I know I'm kind
