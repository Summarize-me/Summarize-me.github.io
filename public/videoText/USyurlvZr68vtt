00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:22.580 align:start position:0%
coming back to the first question things
 

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.950 align:start position:0%
coming back to the first question things
outside<00:09:22.820><c> your</c><00:09:22.940><c> control</c><00:09:23.060><c> and</c><00:09:23.420><c> in</c><00:09:23.660><c> the</c>

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
outside your control and in the

outside your control and in the

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
environment so for your AR it came to be
 

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.370 align:start position:0%

the ground and that just really
connected<00:19:49.390><c> with</c><00:19:49.419><c> people</c><00:19:49.690><c> it's</c><00:19:49.960><c> just</c><00:19:50.080><c> that</c>

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:50.260 align:start position:0%
connected with people it's just that
 

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.930 align:start position:0%
connected with people it's just that

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that people's like oh wow
 

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that people's like oh wow
so<00:19:54.940><c> it</c><00:19:55.360><c> took</c><00:19:55.510><c> some</c><00:19:55.570><c> time</c><00:19:55.809><c> to</c><00:19:55.990><c> figure</c><00:19:56.350><c> out</c><00:19:56.440><c> that</c>

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:56.590 align:start position:0%
so it took some time to figure out that
 

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
so it took some time to figure out that
exact<00:19:56.919><c> that</c><00:19:57.039><c> was</c><00:19:57.159><c> a</c><00:19:57.190><c> weird</c><00:19:57.490><c> more</c><00:19:58.029><c> technologist</c>

00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:58.809 align:start position:0%
exact that was a weird more technologist
 

00:19:58.809 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
exact that was a weird more technologist
to<00:19:58.899><c> come</c><00:19:59.230><c> up</c><00:19:59.320><c> with</c><00:19:59.440><c> that</c><00:19:59.649><c> so</c><00:19:59.889><c> that</c><00:20:00.039><c> was</c><00:20:00.159><c> working</c>

00:20:00.539 --> 00:20:00.549 align:start position:0%
to come up with that so that was working
 

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:02.250 align:start position:0%
to come up with that so that was working
with<00:20:00.700><c> a</c><00:20:00.730><c> lot</c><00:20:00.970><c> I</c><00:20:01.210><c> guess</c><00:20:01.419><c> whatever</c><00:20:01.779><c> I'm</c><00:20:02.080><c> kind</c><00:20:02.230><c> of</c>

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:02.260 align:start position:0%
