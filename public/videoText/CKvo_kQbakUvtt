was sometimes people would come in and

I'd look at you know what they did in
 

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.670 align:start position:0%
I'd look at you know what they did in
the<00:13:26.360><c> past</c><00:13:26.800><c> and</c><00:13:27.360><c> you</c><00:13:27.480><c> know</c><00:13:27.760><c> I</c><00:13:28.040><c> generally</c><00:13:28.440><c> felt</c>

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
like well this looks like someone who's
 

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:32.790 align:start position:0%
like well this looks like someone who's

impressive things in the past surely
 

00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:36.110 align:start position:0%
impressive things in the past surely
they<00:13:34.760><c> thought</c><00:13:35.040><c> through</c><00:13:35.360><c> this</c><00:13:35.639><c> and</c><00:13:35.800><c> they</c><00:13:35.920><c> just</c>

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
they thought through this and they just
 

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.590 align:start position:0%
they thought through this and they just
didn't<00:13:36.480><c> say</c><00:13:36.720><c> it</c><00:13:37.000><c> in</c><00:13:37.760><c> the</c><00:13:37.959><c> meeting</c><00:13:38.959><c> and</c><00:13:39.320><c> uh</c><00:13:39.480><c> one</c>

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
didn't say it in the meeting and uh one
 

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.110 align:start position:0%
didn't say it in the meeting and uh one
of<00:13:39.680><c> the</c><00:13:39.800><c> things</c><00:13:40.040><c> Paul</c><00:13:40.279><c> would</c><00:13:40.480><c> always</c><00:13:40.680><c> say</c><00:13:40.920><c> is</c>

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
of the things Paul would always say is
 

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.269 align:start position:0%
of the things Paul would always say is
like<00:13:41.440><c> oh</c><00:13:41.639><c> no</c><00:13:41.800><c> no</c><00:13:42.000><c> no</c><00:13:42.639><c> if</c><00:13:43.000><c> they</c><00:13:43.120><c> don't</c><00:13:43.360><c> say</c><00:13:43.639><c> it</c>

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
like oh no no no if they don't say it
 

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:47.550 align:start position:0%
like oh no no no if they don't say it
then<00:13:44.920><c> they</c><00:13:45.360><c> themselves</c><00:13:45.720><c> do</c><00:13:45.920><c> not</c><00:13:46.399><c> know</c><00:13:47.399><c> like</c>

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
then they themselves do not know like
 

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.150 align:start position:0%
then they themselves do not know like
the<00:13:47.680><c> writing</c><00:13:48.320><c> is</c><00:13:48.680><c> actually</c><00:13:49.079><c> thinking</c><00:13:50.079><c> and</c><00:13:50.600><c> um</c>

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
the writing is actually thinking and um
 

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.670 align:start position:0%
the writing is actually thinking and um
I<00:13:51.279><c> guess</c><00:13:51.440><c> to</c><00:13:51.680><c> sort</c><00:13:51.880><c> of</c><00:13:52.399><c> torture</c><00:13:52.880><c> this</c><00:13:53.120><c> analogy</c>

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
I guess to sort of torture this analogy
 

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.470 align:start position:0%
I guess to sort of torture this analogy
but<00:13:53.800><c> I</c><00:13:53.920><c> kind</c><00:13:54.040><c> of</c><00:13:54.240><c> like</c><00:13:54.440><c> it</c><00:13:55.000><c> that</c><00:13:55.399><c> um</c><00:13:56.120><c> we</c><00:13:56.279><c> have</c>

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
but I kind of like it that um we have
 

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
but I kind of like it that um we have
we're<00:13:56.600><c> sort</c><00:13:56.759><c> of</c><00:13:56.880><c> in</c><00:13:57.000><c> this</c><00:13:57.199><c> moment</c><00:13:57.680><c> where</c><00:13:58.600><c> uh</c><00:13:58.759><c> if</c>

00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
we're sort of in this moment where uh if
 

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.189 align:start position:0%
we're sort of in this moment where uh if
we<00:13:59.120><c> take</c><00:13:59.279><c> the</c><00:13:59.399><c> analogy</c><00:13:59.839><c> of</c><00:14:00.079><c> like</c><00:14:00.600><c> the</c><00:14:00.880><c> the</c>

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
we take the analogy of like the the
 

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:03.389 align:start position:0%
we take the analogy of like the the
camera<00:14:02.199><c> like</c><00:14:02.480><c> made</c><00:14:02.680><c> it</c><00:14:02.800><c> so</c><00:14:02.959><c> that</c><00:14:03.079><c> you</c><00:14:03.199><c> don't</c>

00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
camera like made it so that you don't
 

00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:05.749 align:start position:0%
camera like made it so that you don't
have<00:14:03.519><c> to</c><00:14:03.680><c> paint</c><00:14:04.000><c> anymore</c><00:14:04.800><c> the</c><00:14:04.920><c> subtlety</c><00:14:05.480><c> there</c>

00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
have to paint anymore the subtlety there
 

00:14:05.759 --> 00:14:07.910 align:start position:0%
have to paint anymore the subtlety there
is<00:14:05.959><c> that</c><00:14:06.160><c> like</c><00:14:06.440><c> Aesthetics</c><00:14:07.240><c> in</c><00:14:07.399><c> the</c><00:14:07.560><c> world</c>

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
is that like Aesthetics in the world
 

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.910 align:start position:0%
is that like Aesthetics in the world
still<00:14:08.399><c> exist</c><00:14:09.079><c> and</c><00:14:09.360><c> I</c><00:14:09.440><c> think</c><00:14:09.600><c> the</c><00:14:09.720><c> Artistry</c><00:14:10.600><c> of</c>

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
still exist and I think the Artistry of
 

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.710 align:start position:0%
still exist and I think the Artistry of
creating<00:14:11.399><c> software</c><00:14:12.040><c> or</c><00:14:12.639><c> technology</c><00:14:13.240><c> products</c>

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
creating software or technology products
 

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.269 align:start position:0%
creating software or technology products
is<00:14:14.040><c> actually</c><00:14:15.040><c> um</c><00:14:15.480><c> in</c><00:14:15.680><c> that</c><00:14:15.880><c> interface</c><00:14:16.440><c> between</c>

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
is actually um in that interface between

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
the human and the technology itself so

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
what should actually even do and how I
 

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.430 align:start position:0%
what should actually even do and how I
think<00:14:50.759><c> that's</c><00:14:50.880><c> a</c><00:14:51.040><c> very</c><00:14:51.199><c> good</c><00:14:51.360><c> point</c><00:14:51.839><c> Gary</c><00:14:52.320><c> I</c>

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
think that's a very good point Gary I
 

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
think that's a very good point Gary I
think<00:14:52.759><c> maybe</c><00:14:53.079><c> the</c><00:14:53.279><c> other</c><00:14:53.880><c> thing</c><00:14:54.320><c> way</c><00:14:54.519><c> to</c><00:14:54.720><c> think</c>

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%

languages as we progress we became more
 

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:06.550 align:start position:0%

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
and more in higher language abstractions
 

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.749 align:start position:0%
and more in higher language abstractions
so<00:15:06.639><c> we</c><00:15:06.759><c> started</c><00:15:07.079><c> with</c><00:15:07.680><c> in</c><00:15:07.800><c> the</c><00:15:07.959><c> early</c><00:15:08.240><c> days</c><00:15:08.680><c> it</c>

00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
so we started with in the early days it
 

00:15:08.759 --> 00:15:10.749 align:start position:0%
so we started with in the early days it
was<00:15:08.959><c> just</c><00:15:09.240><c> very</c><00:15:09.480><c> very</c><00:15:09.680><c> much</c><00:15:09.880><c> like</c><00:15:10.240><c> coding</c><00:15:10.600><c> an</c>

00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
was just very very much like coding an
 

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:13.030 align:start position:0%
was just very very much like coding an
assembly<00:15:11.600><c> yes</c><00:15:12.079><c> and</c><00:15:12.199><c> it</c><00:15:12.279><c> would</c><00:15:12.440><c> took</c><00:15:12.680><c> like</c><00:15:12.839><c> so</c>

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
assembly yes and it would took like so
 

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.350 align:start position:0%
assembly yes and it would took like so
many<00:15:13.279><c> lines</c><00:15:13.480><c> of</c><00:15:13.639><c> code</c><00:15:13.920><c> to</c><00:15:14.120><c> just</c><00:15:14.480><c> do</c><00:15:14.720><c> addition</c>

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
many lines of code to just do addition
 

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.230 align:start position:0%
many lines of code to just do addition
right<00:15:16.040><c> then</c><00:15:16.160><c> you</c><00:15:16.240><c> went</c><00:15:16.440><c> up</c><00:15:16.639><c> and</c><00:15:16.800><c> did</c><00:15:16.920><c> a</c><00:15:17.000><c> bit</c><00:15:17.120><c> of</c>

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
right then you went up and did a bit of
 

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.310 align:start position:0%
right then you went up and did a bit of
things<00:15:17.480><c> like</c><00:15:17.639><c> with</c><00:15:17.759><c> Fortran</c><00:15:18.440><c> and</c><00:15:18.560><c> then</c><00:15:18.680><c> C++</c>

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
things like with Fortran and then C++
 

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.470 align:start position:0%
things like with Fortran and then C++
where<00:15:19.399><c> you</c><00:15:19.480><c> had</c><00:15:19.600><c> to</c><00:15:19.720><c> like</c><00:15:19.920><c> really</c><00:15:20.120><c> know</c><00:15:20.320><c> about</c>

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
where you had to like really know about
 

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.829 align:start position:0%
where you had to like really know about
the<00:15:20.600><c> metal</c><00:15:20.920><c> still</c><00:15:21.120><c> and</c><00:15:21.240><c> manage</c><00:15:21.519><c> your</c><00:15:21.639><c> own</c>

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
the metal still and manage your own
 

00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:24.069 align:start position:0%
the metal still and manage your own
memory<00:15:22.759><c> then</c><00:15:22.880><c> you</c><00:15:23.040><c> went</c><00:15:23.199><c> into</c><00:15:23.560><c> things</c><00:15:23.839><c> that</c>

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
memory then you went into things that
 

00:15:24.079 --> 00:15:26.949 align:start position:0%
memory then you went into things that
with<00:15:24.279><c> more</c><00:15:24.920><c> uh</c><00:15:25.199><c> dynamically</c><00:15:25.800><c> typed</c><00:15:26.160><c> languages</c>

00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:28.110 align:start position:0%
with more uh dynamically typed languages
you<00:15:27.079><c> didn't</c><00:15:27.279><c> have</c><00:15:27.360><c> to</c><00:15:27.480><c> think</c><00:15:27.639><c> about</c><00:15:27.800><c> the</c><00:15:27.920><c> type</c>

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
you didn't have to think about the type
 

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.150 align:start position:0%
you didn't have to think about the type
like<00:15:28.240><c> JavaScript</c><00:15:28.680><c> and</c><00:15:28.759><c> pyth</c><00:15:29.440><c> right</c><00:15:29.759><c> or</c><00:15:29.920><c> duct</c>

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
