00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
same and 20% at at least 80% 80% was the
 

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:42.829 align:start position:0%
same and 20% at at least 80% 80% was the

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
was the minimum that they copied yeah
 

00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:45.150 align:start position:0%
was the minimum that they copied yeah
and<00:10:43.079><c> so</c><00:10:44.000><c> I</c><00:10:44.079><c> think</c><00:10:44.240><c> one</c><00:10:44.360><c> of</c><00:10:44.440><c> the</c><00:10:44.560><c> things</c><00:10:44.760><c> that's</c>

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
and so I think one of the things that's
 

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.829 align:start position:0%
and so I think one of the things that's
Founders<00:10:45.600><c> screw</c><00:10:45.920><c> up</c><00:10:46.120><c> is</c><00:10:46.240><c> when</c><00:10:46.399><c> they</c><00:10:46.560><c> take</c>

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
Founders screw up is when they take
 

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:49.430 align:start position:0%
Founders screw up is when they take
advice<00:10:47.240><c> that</c><00:10:47.399><c> might</c><00:10:47.600><c> work</c><00:10:47.800><c> in</c><00:10:48.240><c> fashion</c><00:10:49.240><c> and</c>

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
advice that might work in fashion and
 

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.550 align:start position:0%
advice that might work in fashion and
apply<00:10:49.760><c> it</c><00:10:49.920><c> to</c><00:10:50.720><c> yeah</c><00:10:51.160><c> software</c><00:10:52.160><c> because</c><00:10:52.399><c> yeah</c>

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
apply it to yeah software because yeah
 

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.750 align:start position:0%
apply it to yeah software because yeah
this<00:10:53.160><c> this</c><00:10:53.240><c> reminds</c><00:10:53.440><c> me</c><00:10:53.519><c> of</c><00:10:53.600><c> usability</c><00:10:54.480><c> if</c>

this this reminds me of usability if
 

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.310 align:start position:0%

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
and how the cursor worked and like how
 

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.230 align:start position:0%
and how the cursor worked and like how

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
you would even click buttons and that
 

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.990 align:start position:0%
you would even click buttons and that
was<00:11:05.399><c> an</c><00:11:05.560><c> example</c><00:11:05.839><c> of</c><00:11:06.079><c> probably</c><00:11:06.360><c> not</c><00:11:06.560><c> helpful</c>

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
was an example of probably not helpful
 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.710 align:start position:0%
was an example of probably not helpful
innovation<00:11:07.760><c> no</c><00:11:08.600><c> um</c><00:11:08.959><c> and</c>

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
innovation no um and
 

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.910 align:start position:0%
innovation no um and
so<00:11:10.720><c> watch</c><00:11:10.920><c> out</c><00:11:11.160><c> for</c><00:11:11.920><c> unintentionally</c>

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
so watch out for unintentionally
 

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.470 align:start position:0%
so watch out for unintentionally
creating<00:11:13.399><c> risk</c><00:11:13.800><c> that</c><00:11:13.880><c> you</c><00:11:14.000><c> don't</c><00:11:14.160><c> need</c><00:11:14.320><c> to</c>

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
creating risk that you don't need to
 

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.829 align:start position:0%
creating risk that you don't need to
create<00:11:15.160><c> yeah</c><00:11:15.480><c> and</c><00:11:15.720><c> and</c><00:11:15.959><c> I</c><00:11:16.040><c> think</c><00:11:16.240><c> that</c><00:11:16.440><c> if</c><00:11:16.839><c> you</c>

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
create yeah and and I think that if you
 

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:19.670 align:start position:0%
create yeah and and I think that if you
put<00:11:18.040><c> your</c><00:11:18.279><c> first</c><00:11:18.680><c> your</c><00:11:18.880><c> customer</c><00:11:19.360><c> first</c>
