00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.530 align:start position:0%
know scaling right like if we can scale
then<00:10:10.399><c> we</c><00:10:11.000><c> could</c><00:10:11.149><c> go</c><00:10:11.240><c> get</c><00:10:11.360><c> ice</c><00:10:11.510><c> cream</c><00:10:11.660><c> next</c><00:10:11.990><c> time</c>

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:13.540 align:start position:0%
