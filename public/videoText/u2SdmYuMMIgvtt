example<00:23:31.580><c> because</c><00:23:31.850><c> there's</c><00:23:32.030><c> people</c><00:23:32.720><c> been</c>

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
example because there's people been
 

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.250 align:start position:0%
example because there's people been
doing<00:23:32.870><c> like</c><00:23:33.080><c> this</c><00:23:34.630><c> the</c><00:23:35.630><c> more</c><00:23:35.840><c> kind</c><00:23:35.960><c> of</c><00:23:36.050><c> I</c><00:23:36.200><c> think</c>

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:36.260 align:start position:0%
doing like this the more kind of I think
 

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.350 align:start position:0%
doing like this the more kind of I think
useful<00:23:36.560><c> example</c><00:23:37.160><c> is</c><00:23:37.310><c> make</c><00:23:37.670><c> something</c><00:23:38.000><c> useful</c>

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
useful example is make something useful
 

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.930 align:start position:0%
useful example is make something useful
right<00:23:38.540><c> so</c><00:23:39.350><c> I</c><00:23:39.530><c> think</c><00:23:39.650><c> it's</c><00:23:39.950><c> really</c><00:23:40.310><c> easy</c><00:23:40.490><c> to</c>

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:40.940 align:start position:0%
right so I think it's really easy to
 

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:44.020 align:start position:0%
right so I think it's really easy to
just<00:23:41.120><c> be</c><00:23:41.450><c> like</c><00:23:41.630><c> I</c><00:23:42.220><c> took</c><00:23:43.220><c> this</c><00:23:43.340><c> algorithm</c><00:23:44.000><c> that</c>

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.030 align:start position:0%
just be like I took this algorithm that
 

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
just be like I took this algorithm that
used<00:23:44.360><c> to</c><00:23:44.480><c> operate</c><00:23:44.750><c> at</c><00:23:45.230><c> 99.1</c><00:23:46.040><c> percent</c><00:23:46.190><c> and</c><00:23:46.880><c> now</c>

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.090 align:start position:0%
used to operate at 99.1 percent and now
 

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.610 align:start position:0%
used to operate at 99.1 percent and now

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:48.620 align:start position:0%
accuracy and now I'm gonna make it
 

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.590 align:start position:0%

then you iterate and you fix it and get
 

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.290 align:start position:0%
then you iterate and you fix it and get
better<00:28:24.350><c> and</c><00:28:24.710><c> so</c><00:28:24.830><c> the</c><00:28:25.309><c> model</c><00:28:25.640><c> at</c><00:28:25.760><c> insight</c><00:28:26.120><c> is</c>

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:26.300 align:start position:0%
better and so the model at insight is
 

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.530 align:start position:0%
better and so the model at insight is
really<00:28:26.630><c> just</c><00:28:27.050><c> continual</c><00:28:27.470><c> feedback</c><00:28:27.620><c> so</c><00:28:28.250><c> if</c><00:28:29.179><c> at</c>

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:29.540 align:start position:0%
really just continual feedback so if at
 

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:30.700 align:start position:0%
really just continual feedback so if at

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:30.710 align:start position:0%
the end of the program I tell you like
 

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
the end of the program I tell you like
no<00:28:30.830><c> that's</c><00:28:31.040><c> wrong</c><00:28:31.220><c> then</c><00:28:31.429><c> that's</c><00:28:31.550><c> a</c><00:28:31.730><c> bad</c>

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:31.970 align:start position:0%
no that's wrong then that's a bad

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:13.049 align:start position:0%
scientist need to beware of that you're
 

00:29:13.049 --> 00:29:14.089 align:start position:0%
scientist need to beware of that you're
just<00:29:13.139><c> gonna</c><00:29:13.229><c> walk</c><00:29:13.469><c> into</c><00:29:13.649><c> this</c><00:29:13.829><c> and</c><00:29:14.009><c> there's</c>

00:29:14.089 --> 00:29:14.099 align:start position:0%
just gonna walk into this and there's
 

00:29:14.099 --> 00:29:16.219 align:start position:0%
just gonna walk into this and there's
something<00:29:14.399><c> like</c><00:29:14.690><c> startups</c><00:29:15.690><c> need</c><00:29:15.899><c> to</c><00:29:16.019><c> start</c>

00:29:16.219 --> 00:29:16.229 align:start position:0%
something like startups need to start
 

00:29:16.229 --> 00:29:18.019 align:start position:0%
something like startups need to start
thinking<00:29:16.379><c> about</c><00:29:16.679><c> and</c><00:29:17.129><c> about</c><00:29:17.309><c> like</c><00:29:17.459><c> what</c><00:29:17.700><c> can</c>

00:29:18.019 --> 00:29:18.029 align:start position:0%
thinking about and about like what can
 

00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:21.079 align:start position:0%

00:29:21.079 --> 00:29:21.089 align:start position:0%
they do to like prevent that both but I
 

00:29:21.089 --> 00:29:22.669 align:start position:0%
they do to like prevent that both but I
think<00:29:21.479><c> you</c><00:29:21.539><c> could</c><00:29:21.659><c> never</c><00:29:21.839><c> avoid</c><00:29:22.200><c> it</c><00:29:22.320><c> so</c><00:29:22.440><c> it</c>

00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
think you could never avoid it so it
 

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:24.169 align:start position:0%
think you could never avoid it so it

00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
really is the data scientist job to be

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:18.380 align:start position:0%
but that might be enough and then and
 

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
but that might be enough and then and
then<00:31:18.560><c> a</c><00:31:18.590><c> year</c><00:31:18.770><c> later</c><00:31:18.830><c> you</c><00:31:19.130><c> can</c><00:31:19.250><c> get</c><00:31:19.550><c> started</c>

me like five or ten things that I should
 

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.790 align:start position:0%
me like five or ten things that I should

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
be tracking well I mean it really
 

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.370 align:start position:0%
be tracking well I mean it really
depends<00:32:31.100><c> on</c><00:32:31.220><c> the</c><00:32:31.370><c> company</c><00:32:31.730><c> right</c><00:32:31.970><c> ok</c><00:32:32.900><c> fine</c><00:32:33.200><c> so</c>

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:33.380 align:start position:0%
depends on the company right ok fine so
 

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.770 align:start position:0%
depends on the company right ok fine so
so<00:32:34.040><c> I</c><00:32:34.070><c> I</c><00:32:34.400><c> think</c><00:32:34.610><c> the</c><00:32:35.000><c> the</c><00:32:35.030><c> number</c><00:32:35.450><c> one</c><00:32:35.480><c> thing</c>

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:35.780 align:start position:0%
so I I think the the number one thing
 

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
so I I think the the number one thing
you<00:32:35.930><c> have</c><00:32:36.110><c> to</c><00:32:36.260><c> think</c><00:32:36.440><c> about</c><00:32:36.530><c> as</c><00:32:36.710><c> a</c><00:32:36.740><c> founder</c><00:32:37.070><c> is</c>

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:37.130 align:start position:0%
you have to think about as a founder is
 

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:38.380 align:start position:0%
you have to think about as a founder is
actually<00:32:37.370><c> not</c><00:32:37.520><c> even</c><00:32:37.640><c> what</c><00:32:37.880><c> you're</c><00:32:38.000><c> tracking</c>

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:38.390 align:start position:0%
actually not even what you're tracking
 

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.450 align:start position:0%
actually not even what you're tracking
because<00:32:38.600><c> honestly</c><00:32:39.320><c> if</c><00:32:39.620><c> you</c><00:32:39.980><c> think</c><00:32:40.220><c> about</c><00:32:40.310><c> this</c>

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:40.460 align:start position:0%
because honestly if you think about this
 

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.290 align:start position:0%
because honestly if you think about this
first<00:32:40.700><c> thing</c><00:32:40.850><c> right</c>

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:41.300 align:start position:0%
first thing right
 

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.910 align:start position:0%
first thing right
I<00:32:41.330><c> think</c><00:32:41.750><c> that'll</c><00:32:41.930><c> become</c><00:32:42.050><c> more</c><00:32:42.290><c> obvious</c><00:32:42.380><c> yeah</c>

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
I think that'll become more obvious yeah
 

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
I think that'll become more obvious yeah
the<00:32:43.610><c> first</c><00:32:43.880><c> thing</c><00:32:43.940><c> you</c><00:32:44.090><c> got</c><00:32:44.210><c> to</c><00:32:44.240><c> think</c><00:32:44.390><c> about</c><00:32:44.540><c> I</c>

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:44.930 align:start position:0%
the first thing you got to think about I
 

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
the first thing you got to think about I

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:46.730 align:start position:0%
think about it right is what are you
 

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
think about it right is what are you

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.559 align:start position:0%
so to me it's just like okay what drives
those<00:34:59.430><c> two</c><00:34:59.700><c> things</c><00:34:59.940><c> are</c><00:35:00.089><c> really</c><00:35:00.210><c> just</c><00:35:00.450><c> like</c>

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:00.569 align:start position:0%
those two things are really just like
 

00:35:00.569 --> 00:35:02.660 align:start position:0%
those two things are really just like
only<00:35:01.380><c> two</c><00:35:01.530><c> numbers</c><00:35:01.829><c> it's</c><00:35:01.950><c> like</c><00:35:02.069><c> conversion</c>

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:02.670 align:start position:0%
only two numbers it's like conversion
 

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.940 align:start position:0%
only two numbers it's like conversion
and<00:35:02.910><c> then</c><00:35:03.510><c> like</c><00:35:03.660><c> churn</c><00:35:03.960><c> yeah</c><00:35:04.290><c> and</c><00:35:04.470><c> so</c><00:35:04.890><c> I</c>

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:04.950 align:start position:0%
and then like churn yeah and so I
 

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.980 align:start position:0%
and then like churn yeah and so I
imagine<00:35:05.130><c> like</c><00:35:05.430><c> most</c><00:35:06.030><c> questions</c><00:35:06.510><c> fall</c><00:35:06.750><c> into</c>

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:06.990 align:start position:0%
imagine like most questions fall into
 

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.170 align:start position:0%
imagine like most questions fall into
those<00:35:07.140><c> two</c><00:35:07.470><c> cats</c><00:35:07.980><c> like</c><00:35:08.099><c> what</c><00:35:08.430><c> increases</c>

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
those two cats like what increases
 

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.900 align:start position:0%
those two cats like what increases
conversion<00:35:10.049><c> for</c><00:35:10.260><c> a</c><00:35:10.290><c> revenue</c><00:35:10.710><c> oh</c><00:35:10.950><c> and</c><00:35:11.790><c> what</c>

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:11.910 align:start position:0%
conversion for a revenue oh and what
 

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.490 align:start position:0%
conversion for a revenue oh and what
reduces<00:35:12.329><c> trend</c><00:35:12.569><c> for</c><00:35:12.690><c> revenue</c><00:35:12.990><c> and</c><00:35:13.170><c> the</c><00:35:13.290><c> same</c>

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
reduces trend for revenue and the same
 

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.049 align:start position:0%
reduces trend for revenue and the same
thing<00:35:13.710><c> for</c><00:35:13.740><c> like</c><00:35:14.069><c> engagement</c><00:35:14.460><c> so</c><00:35:14.760><c> those</c><00:35:14.910><c> are</c>

00:35:15.049 --> 00:35:15.059 align:start position:0%
thing for like engagement so those are
 

00:35:15.059 --> 00:35:16.460 align:start position:0%
thing for like engagement so those are
so<00:35:15.299><c> i'll</c><00:35:15.420><c> maybe</c><00:35:15.720><c> i'll</c><00:35:15.839><c> speak</c><00:35:16.049><c> directly</c><00:35:16.319><c> to</c>

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:22.049 align:start position:0%
mean I I think it's it's coming back to
 

00:37:22.049 --> 00:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
mean I I think it's it's coming back to
turn<00:37:22.259><c> right</c><00:37:22.470><c> because</c><00:37:22.650><c> if</c><00:37:22.769><c> you're</c><00:37:22.920><c> if</c><00:37:23.099><c> you're</c>

turn right because if you're if you're
 

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:25.190 align:start position:0%
turn right because if you're if you're

seeing folks drop off at month three and
 

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.349 align:start position:0%
seeing folks drop off at month three and
like<00:37:25.410><c> you're</c><00:37:25.980><c> your</c><00:37:26.279><c> early</c><00:37:26.489><c> cohorts</c><00:37:26.910><c> I</c><00:37:27.029><c> mean</c><00:37:27.180><c> I</c>

00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
like you're your early cohorts I mean I
 

00:37:27.359 --> 00:37:28.759 align:start position:0%
like you're your early cohorts I mean I
mean<00:37:27.749><c> that's</c><00:37:27.900><c> a</c><00:37:27.960><c> term</c><00:37:28.140><c> problem</c><00:37:28.440><c> right</c><00:37:28.589><c> there</c>

00:37:28.759 --> 00:37:28.769 align:start position:0%
mean that's a term problem right there
 

00:37:28.769 --> 00:37:30.739 align:start position:0%
mean that's a term problem right there
so<00:37:28.980><c> yeah</c><00:37:29.519><c> I</c><00:37:29.549><c> think</c><00:37:29.789><c> it</c><00:37:29.970><c> goes</c><00:37:29.999><c> back</c><00:37:30.239><c> to</c><00:37:30.299><c> churn</c><00:37:30.569><c> a</c>

00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:30.749 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think it goes back to churn a
 

00:37:30.749 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think it goes back to churn a
lot<00:37:31.019><c> of</c><00:37:31.140><c> those</c><00:37:31.259><c> sort</c><00:37:31.380><c> of</c><00:37:31.470><c> dashboards</c><00:37:32.039><c> are</c><00:37:32.220><c> you</c>

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:32.730 align:start position:0%

00:37:34.279 --> 00:37:34.289 align:start position:0%
know are are you know there are great
 

00:37:34.289 --> 00:37:36.109 align:start position:0%
know are are you know there are great
tools<00:37:34.319><c> for</c><00:37:34.769><c> those</c><00:37:34.890><c> so</c><00:37:35.160><c> certainly</c><00:37:35.460><c> like</c><00:37:35.700><c> when</c><00:37:36.089><c> I</c>

00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
tools for those so certainly like when I
 

00:37:36.119 --> 00:37:38.269 align:start position:0%
tools for those so certainly like when I
started<00:37:36.539><c> people</c><00:37:37.259><c> with</c><00:37:37.349><c> like</c><00:37:37.470><c> hand</c><00:37:37.739><c> code</c><00:37:37.950><c> like</c>

00:37:38.269 --> 00:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
started people with like hand code like
 

00:37:38.279 --> 00:37:39.170 align:start position:0%
started people with like hand code like

now there's a bunch of tools for that so
 

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.380 align:start position:0%
now there's a bunch of tools for that so
I'm<00:37:41.160><c> not</c><00:37:41.460><c> saying</c><00:37:41.670><c> so</c><00:37:41.880><c> certainly</c><00:37:42.089><c> I</c><00:37:42.150><c> think</c><00:37:42.180><c> in</c>

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:42.390 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying so certainly I think in
 

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%

up and then just letting it go what
happens<00:43:20.210><c> yeah</c><00:43:20.599><c> I</c><00:43:20.630><c> think</c><00:43:20.990><c> contracting</c><00:43:21.589><c> is</c><00:43:21.710><c> good</c>

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:21.859 align:start position:0%
happens yeah I think contracting is good
 

00:43:21.859 --> 00:43:24.849 align:start position:0%
happens yeah I think contracting is good
for<00:43:22.099><c> prototyping</c><00:43:22.490><c> so</c><00:43:23.240><c> we</c><00:43:23.390><c> see</c><00:43:23.599><c> a</c><00:43:23.630><c> lot</c><00:43:23.930><c> of</c><00:43:23.960><c> like</c>

00:43:24.849 --> 00:43:24.859 align:start position:0%
