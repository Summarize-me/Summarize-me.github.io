a zero same game is a game that you play
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.790 align:start position:0%
a zero same game is a game that you play
where<00:00:52.559><c> the</c><00:00:52.800><c> upside</c><00:00:53.280><c> that</c><00:00:53.440><c> you're</c><00:00:53.680><c> getting</c>

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
where the upside that you're getting
 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.549 align:start position:0%
where the upside that you're getting
comes<00:00:55.199><c> directly</c><00:00:55.600><c> from</c><00:00:55.760><c> the</c><00:00:55.920><c> other</c><00:00:56.079><c> player</c><00:00:56.399><c> so</c>

comes directly from the other player so
 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.950 align:start position:0%
comes directly from the other player so
if<00:00:56.640><c> we're</c><00:00:56.800><c> talking</c><00:00:57.039><c> about</c><00:00:57.280><c> money</c><00:00:58.239><c> um</c><00:00:58.800><c> a</c>

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about money um a
 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.430 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about money um a
classic<00:00:59.359><c> zero-sum</c><00:00:59.840><c> game</c><00:01:00.079><c> is</c><00:01:00.160><c> we</c><00:01:00.320><c> make</c><00:01:00.559><c> a</c><00:01:00.640><c> bet</c>

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's created in the system it's zero
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.109 align:start position:0%
that's created in the system it's zero
sum<00:01:13.920><c> so</c><00:01:14.159><c> whatever</c>

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
sum so whatever
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.590 align:start position:0%
sum so whatever
whatever<00:01:15.439><c> you</c><00:01:15.680><c> gain</c><00:01:16.000><c> i</c><00:01:16.240><c> lose</c><00:01:17.040><c> and</c><00:01:17.200><c> it</c><00:01:17.360><c> all</c>

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
equals that to zero okay that's zero sum
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.870 align:start position:0%
equals that to zero okay that's zero sum
a<00:01:21.200><c> positive</c><00:01:21.759><c> sum</c><00:01:22.080><c> game</c>

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
a positive sum game
 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.950 align:start position:0%
a positive sum game
is<00:01:23.200><c> where</c><00:01:23.600><c> something</c><00:01:24.159><c> happens</c><00:01:24.560><c> and</c><00:01:24.720><c> as</c><00:01:24.880><c> a</c>

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
is where something happens and as a
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 align:start position:0%
is where something happens and as a
consequence<00:01:25.520><c> of</c><00:01:25.680><c> it</c>

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
consequence of it
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.710 align:start position:0%
consequence of it
value<00:01:26.960><c> is</c><00:01:27.119><c> created</c><00:01:27.520><c> that</c><00:01:27.680><c> lasts</c><00:01:28.000><c> for</c><00:01:28.159><c> a</c><00:01:28.240><c> while</c>

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
value is created that lasts for a while
 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.109 align:start position:0%
value is created that lasts for a while
and<00:01:28.880><c> so</c><00:01:29.119><c> say</c><00:01:29.360><c> that</c><00:01:29.600><c> we</c><00:01:30.000><c> um</c>

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
and so say that we um
 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.230 align:start position:0%
and so say that we um
you<00:01:31.280><c> know</c>

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
those scenarios it was a we made
 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.950 align:start position:0%
those scenarios it was a we made
something<00:02:00.000><c> that</c><00:02:00.159><c> last</c><00:02:00.399><c> and</c><00:02:00.479><c> the</c><00:02:00.560><c> other</c><00:02:00.719><c> one</c><00:02:00.880><c> it</c>

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
something that last and the other one it
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.789 align:start position:0%
something that last and the other one it
was<00:02:01.119><c> just</c><00:02:01.200><c> a</c><00:02:01.360><c> zero</c><00:02:01.600><c> sum</c><00:02:01.840><c> form</c><00:02:02.159><c> entertainment</c>

than<00:13:01.200><c> that</c><00:13:01.519><c> and</c><00:13:01.680><c> so</c>

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
than that and so
 

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.110 align:start position:0%
than that and so
i<00:13:03.440><c> think</c><00:13:04.079><c> you</c><00:13:04.240><c> kind</c><00:13:04.480><c> of</c><00:13:04.560><c> want</c><00:13:04.720><c> to</c><00:13:04.800><c> look</c><00:13:04.959><c> for</c>

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think you kind of want to look for

a startup whether it's a job even if
 

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
a startup whether it's a job even if
