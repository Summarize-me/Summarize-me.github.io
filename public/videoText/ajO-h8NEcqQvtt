00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:45.150 align:start position:0%
post I called out something like five
years<00:13:43.420><c> because</c><00:13:43.959><c> I</c><00:13:44.079><c> think</c><00:13:44.230><c> what</c><00:13:45.069><c> you're</c>

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.110 align:start position:0%
take a while right and I do think there
 

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.259 align:start position:0%
take a while right and I do think there
is<00:13:50.170><c> a</c><00:13:50.259><c> cultural</c><00:13:50.620><c> shift</c><00:13:50.649><c> and</c><00:13:51.399><c> the</c><00:13:51.970><c> cultural</c>

00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:52.269 align:start position:0%
is a cultural shift and the cultural
 

00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:54.689 align:start position:0%
is a cultural shift and the cultural
shift<00:13:52.329><c> essentially</c><00:13:52.990><c> is</c><00:13:53.139><c> that</c><00:13:54.069><c> generation</c><00:13:54.639><c> of</c>

00:13:54.689 --> 00:13:54.699 align:start position:0%
shift essentially is that generation of
 

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
shift essentially is that generation of

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
parents that were 18 in the year 2000 or
 

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.369 align:start position:0%
parents that were 18 in the year 2000 or
you<00:13:58.269><c> know</c><00:13:58.329><c> their</c><00:13:58.480><c> parents</c><00:13:58.809><c> now</c><00:13:59.079><c> and</c><00:13:59.110><c> they</c><00:13:59.259><c> have</c>

00:13:59.369 --> 00:13:59.379 align:start position:0%
you know their parents now and they have
 

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
you know their parents now and they have
five-year-olds<00:13:59.949><c> right</c><00:14:00.279><c> there</c><00:14:00.459><c> so</c><00:14:00.579><c> the</c><00:14:00.730><c> person</c>

00:14:01.139 --> 00:14:01.149 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds right there so the person
 

00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:03.210 align:start position:0%
five-year-olds right there so the person
that<00:14:01.180><c> was</c><00:14:01.329><c> 18</c><00:14:01.629><c> in</c><00:14:01.749><c> the</c><00:14:01.809><c> year</c><00:14:01.930><c> 2000</c><00:14:02.379><c> be</c><00:14:02.499><c> 36</c><00:14:03.009><c> today</c>

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:03.220 align:start position:0%
that was 18 in the year 2000 be 36 today
 

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.889 align:start position:0%
that was 18 in the year 2000 be 36 today
so<00:14:03.999><c> I</c><00:14:04.059><c> probably</c><00:14:04.269><c> you</c><00:14:04.509><c> know</c><00:14:04.600><c> they</c><00:14:04.720><c> might</c><00:14:04.870><c> have</c>

00:14:04.889 --> 00:14:04.899 align:start position:0%
so I probably you know they might have
 

00:14:04.899 --> 00:14:06.809 align:start position:0%
so I probably you know they might have
some<00:14:05.170><c> young</c><00:14:05.319><c> kids</c><00:14:05.559><c> and</c><00:14:06.430><c> I</c><00:14:06.490><c> think</c><00:14:06.670><c> they're</c>

00:14:06.809 --> 00:14:06.819 align:start position:0%
some young kids and I think they're
 

00:14:06.819 --> 00:14:08.429 align:start position:0%
some young kids and I think they're

00:14:08.429 --> 00:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
starting to look back at you know they
 

00:14:08.439 --> 00:14:09.809 align:start position:0%
starting to look back at you know they
probably<00:14:08.529><c> don't</c><00:14:08.860><c> have</c><00:14:08.949><c> a</c><00:14:09.009><c> 25</c><00:14:09.399><c> year</c><00:14:09.610><c> old</c><00:14:09.730><c> but</c>

00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:09.819 align:start position:0%
probably don't have a 25 year old but
 

00:14:09.819 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
probably don't have a 25 year old but
they<00:14:09.879><c> might</c><00:14:10.029><c> have</c><00:14:10.059><c> a</c><00:14:10.209><c> 6</c><00:14:10.480><c> year</c><00:14:10.540><c> older</c><00:14:10.839><c> and</c><00:14:10.870><c> 8</c>

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:11.050 align:start position:0%
they might have a 6 year older and 8
 

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.569 align:start position:0%
they might have a 6 year older and 8
year<00:14:11.170><c> old</c><00:14:11.350><c> so</c><00:14:11.920><c> starting</c><00:14:12.189><c> to</c><00:14:12.249><c> look</c><00:14:12.339><c> back</c><00:14:12.459><c> at</c>

00:14:12.569 --> 00:14:12.579 align:start position:0%
year old so starting to look back at
 

00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
year old so starting to look back at
their<00:14:12.670><c> life</c><00:14:12.879><c> and</c><00:14:13.029><c> saying</c><00:14:13.180><c> wait</c><00:14:13.329><c> a</c><00:14:13.420><c> second</c><00:14:13.749><c> like</c>

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:13.930 align:start position:0%
their life and saying wait a second like
 

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
their life and saying wait a second like
what<00:14:14.350><c> happened</c><00:14:14.709><c> over</c><00:14:14.980><c> the</c><00:14:15.069><c> world</c><00:14:15.249><c> changed</c><00:14:15.759><c> and</c>

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
what happened over the world changed and
 

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
what happened over the world changed and
so<00:14:15.970><c> I</c><00:14:15.999><c> think</c><00:14:16.089><c> people</c><00:14:16.389><c> are</c><00:14:16.480><c> generally</c><00:14:16.720><c> pretty</c>

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:16.870 align:start position:0%
so I think people are generally pretty
 

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.059 align:start position:0%
so I think people are generally pretty
smart<00:14:17.290><c> and</c><00:14:17.439><c> so</c><00:14:17.529><c> they're</c><00:14:17.680><c> started</c><00:14:17.980><c> that</c>

00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:18.069 align:start position:0%
smart and so they're started that
 

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:19.799 align:start position:0%
smart and so they're started that
cultural<00:14:18.370><c> change</c><00:14:18.579><c> is</c><00:14:18.670><c> starting</c><00:14:18.879><c> to</c><00:14:18.970><c> happen</c><00:14:19.269><c> or</c>

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:19.809 align:start position:0%
cultural change is starting to happen or
 

00:14:19.809 --> 00:14:21.449 align:start position:0%
cultural change is starting to happen or
that<00:14:20.139><c> might</c><00:14:20.319><c> be</c><00:14:20.470><c> the</c><00:14:20.589><c> 36</c><00:14:20.980><c> year</c><00:14:21.100><c> old</c><00:14:21.129><c> that's</c><00:14:21.309><c> now</c>

00:14:21.449 --> 00:14:21.459 align:start position:0%

is looking at it and saying wait a

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:24.939 align:start position:0%
second I grew up with the Internet like
 

00:14:24.939 --> 00:14:26.970 align:start position:0%
second I grew up with the Internet like
I<00:14:25.149><c> get</c><00:14:25.480><c> this</c><00:14:25.660><c> we</c><00:14:26.230><c> should</c><00:14:26.379><c> be</c><00:14:26.500><c> better</c><00:14:26.680><c> buying</c>

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:26.980 align:start position:0%
I get this we should be better buying
 

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.530 align:start position:0%
I get this we should be better buying
better<00:14:27.189><c> stuff</c><00:14:27.519><c> and</c><00:14:27.699><c> so</c><00:14:27.790><c> I</c><00:14:28.029><c> do</c><00:14:28.300><c> think</c><00:14:28.509><c> that</c>

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:28.540 align:start position:0%
better stuff and so I do think that
 

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.910 align:start position:0%
better stuff and so I do think that
change<00:14:28.779><c> is</c><00:14:28.870><c> happening</c><00:14:29.079><c> but</c><00:14:29.439><c> we're</c><00:14:29.529><c> kind</c><00:14:29.709><c> of</c><00:14:29.800><c> at</c>

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
like the early parts of that change and
 

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:33.809 align:start position:0%
like the early parts of that change and
hopefully<00:14:32.860><c> it</c><00:14:33.009><c> accelerates</c><00:14:33.430><c> but</c><00:14:33.519><c> I</c><00:14:33.550><c> don't</c>

00:14:33.809 --> 00:14:33.819 align:start position:0%
hopefully it accelerates but I don't
 

00:14:33.819 --> 00:14:34.769 align:start position:0%
hopefully it accelerates but I don't

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:34.550 align:start position:0%
your point too I think is that just
 

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.950 align:start position:0%
your point too I think is that just

so I think looking forward now so I
 

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.060 align:start position:0%
so I think looking forward now so I
think<00:20:11.420><c> the</c><00:20:12.080><c> question</c><00:20:12.380><c> really</c><00:20:12.410><c> is</c><00:20:12.710><c> like</c><00:20:12.890><c> are</c>

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.070 align:start position:0%
think the question really is like are
 

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.340 align:start position:0%
think the question really is like are
they<00:20:13.280><c> still</c><00:20:13.490><c> true</c><00:20:14.030><c> today</c><00:20:14.210><c> take</c><00:20:14.720><c> a</c><00:20:14.780><c> snapshot</c><00:20:14.990><c> I</c>

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
they still true today take a snapshot I
 

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.130 align:start position:0%
they still true today take a snapshot I
think<00:20:15.770><c> the</c><00:20:15.830><c> answer</c><00:20:16.040><c> is</c><00:20:16.070><c> mostly</c><00:20:16.460><c> still</c><00:20:16.760><c> true</c>

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.140 align:start position:0%
think the answer is mostly still true
 

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.970 align:start position:0%
think the answer is mostly still true
but<00:20:18.140><c> that's</c><00:20:18.200><c> not</c><00:20:18.380><c> really</c><00:20:18.590><c> the</c><00:20:18.680><c> question</c><00:20:18.770><c> that</c>

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:18.980 align:start position:0%
but that's not really the question that
 

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
but that's not really the question that
that<00:20:19.580><c> like</c><00:20:19.730><c> a</c><00:20:19.760><c> startups</c><00:20:20.180><c> should</c><00:20:20.210><c> be</c><00:20:20.360><c> asking</c>

that like a startups should be asking
 

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
that like a startups should be asking

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:21.770 align:start position:0%
our founders should be asking is like
 

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.740 align:start position:0%
our founders should be asking is like

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:23.750 align:start position:0%
will it be true in five years I don't
 

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:24.820 align:start position:0%
will it be true in five years I don't
think<00:20:23.930><c> it</c><00:20:24.020><c> will</c><00:20:24.110><c> be</c><00:20:24.200><c> true</c><00:20:24.350><c> in</c><00:20:24.470><c> five</c><00:20:24.620><c> years</c>

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:24.830 align:start position:0%
think it will be true in five years
 

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
think it will be true in five years
right<00:20:25.040><c> like</c><00:20:25.160><c> if</c><00:20:25.250><c> you're</c><00:20:25.340><c> starting</c><00:20:25.490><c> a</c><00:20:25.640><c> company</c>

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.810 align:start position:0%
five years it will be dramatically
different<00:20:33.530><c> and</c><00:20:33.830><c> look</c><00:20:34.070><c> a</c><00:20:34.160><c> lot</c><00:20:34.340><c> more</c><00:20:34.520><c> like</c><00:20:34.580><c> your</c>

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:36.590 align:start position:0%

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.410 align:start position:0%
early adopters and I think it will well
they're<00:20:36.710><c> all</c><00:20:36.800><c> forward-looking</c><00:20:37.420><c> statements</c>

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:41.380 align:start position:0%
so I think you're basically saying
 

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
so I think you're basically saying

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
get pretty substantial traction and so
 

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.260 align:start position:0%

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:14.750 align:start position:0%
growth pretty quickly I think the part
 

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.660 align:start position:0%
growth pretty quickly I think the part
of<00:21:14.840><c> it</c><00:21:14.930><c> that's</c><00:21:14.960><c> still</c><00:21:15.710><c> hard</c><00:21:16.040><c> is</c><00:21:16.310><c> actually</c><00:21:16.580><c> the</c>

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:16.670 align:start position:0%
of it that's still hard is actually the
 

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.180 align:start position:0%
of it that's still hard is actually the
monetization<00:21:16.940><c> and</c><00:21:17.720><c> and</c><00:21:18.110><c> I</c><00:21:18.440><c> think</c><00:21:18.500><c> that</c><00:21:18.650><c> part</c>

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.190 align:start position:0%
monetization and and I think that part
 

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.740 align:start position:0%
monetization and and I think that part
of<00:21:19.280><c> it</c><00:21:19.460><c> is</c><00:21:19.610><c> just</c><00:21:19.910><c> gonna</c><00:21:20.030><c> be</c><00:21:20.150><c> phase</c><00:21:20.300><c> shift</c><00:21:20.540><c> and</c><00:21:20.690><c> I</c>

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:20.750 align:start position:0%
of it is just gonna be phase shift and I
 

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.220 align:start position:0%
of it is just gonna be phase shift and I
think<00:21:20.900><c> that</c><00:21:21.020><c> will</c><00:21:21.170><c> come</c><00:21:21.700><c> and</c><00:21:22.700><c> so</c><00:21:23.420><c> it's</c><00:21:23.690><c> it</c><00:21:24.050><c> kind</c>

the market and so I think some of those
have<00:22:21.380><c> moved</c><00:22:21.620><c> much</c><00:22:22.310><c> more</c><00:22:22.520><c> than</c><00:22:22.670><c> others</c><00:22:22.850><c> and</c><00:22:22.880><c> the</c>

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.090 align:start position:0%
have moved much more than others and the
 

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.670 align:start position:0%
have moved much more than others and the

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
trajectory looks really good so I think

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:28.490 align:start position:0%

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.770 align:start position:0%
years and some of the I think we'll just
take<00:22:28.640><c> a</c><00:22:28.670><c> while</c><00:22:28.970><c> longer</c><00:22:29.210><c> like</c><00:22:29.480><c> I</c><00:22:29.630><c> actually</c>

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:29.780 align:start position:0%
take a while longer like I actually
 

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.050 align:start position:0%
take a while longer like I actually

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:32.060 align:start position:0%

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
are smaller and niche and then they
 

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.370 align:start position:0%
are smaller and niche and then they

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
would come down in price over time
 

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
come down dramatically and therefore you
 

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%

what to do it's a great question I think

I think you're basically I mean the that
 

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.740 align:start position:0%
I think you're basically I mean the that

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:17.750 align:start position:0%
is the core of the problem right is like
 

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.350 align:start position:0%
is the core of the problem right is like
what<00:33:18.350><c> are</c><00:33:18.440><c> we</c><00:33:18.530><c> actually</c><00:33:18.680><c> building</c><00:33:19.400><c> the</c>

what are we actually building the

great answer right now honestly and I
 

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.190 align:start position:0%

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:50.410 align:start position:0%
standard you you very quickly start to
 

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.170 align:start position:0%
standard you you very quickly start to

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:52.180 align:start position:0%
make decisions which will be at odds
 

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.970 align:start position:0%
make decisions which will be at odds
with<00:40:52.390><c> what</c><00:40:52.660><c> any</c><00:40:52.840><c> one</c><00:40:53.050><c> individual</c><00:40:53.530><c> would</c><00:40:53.740><c> want</c>

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:53.980 align:start position:0%
with what any one individual would want
 

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.250 align:start position:0%
with what any one individual would want
for<00:40:54.130><c> themselves</c><00:40:54.310><c> because</c><00:40:55.240><c> it's</c><00:40:55.720><c> it's</c><00:40:55.990><c> best</c>

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:56.260 align:start position:0%
for themselves because it's it's best
 

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%

for<00:40:56.410><c> society</c><00:40:56.730><c> yeah</c><00:40:57.730><c> and</c><00:40:58.090><c> I</c><00:40:58.270><c> think</c><00:40:58.360><c> like</c>

00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:58.570 align:start position:0%
for society yeah and I think like
 

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.930 align:start position:0%
for society yeah and I think like
probably<00:40:59.290><c> not</c><00:40:59.470><c> a</c><00:40:59.590><c> little</c><00:40:59.860><c> bit</c><00:40:59.950><c> more</c><00:41:00.160><c> to</c><00:41:00.610><c> me</c><00:41:00.760><c> the</c>

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:00.940 align:start position:0%
probably not a little bit more to me the
 

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
probably not a little bit more to me the

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:04.030 align:start position:0%
hardest trade-offs are actually for the
 

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
hardest trade-offs are actually for the

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:05.650 align:start position:0%
individual in those sort of like edge
 

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.260 align:start position:0%

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:12.310 align:start position:0%
one direction and you could go really
 

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.580 align:start position:0%

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
other direction like setting aside some
 

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.210 align:start position:0%

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.130 align:start position:0%

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:20.140 align:start position:0%

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.990 align:start position:0%
math and you're you're going to a good
college<00:41:20.320><c> like</c><00:41:21.100><c> so</c><00:41:21.430><c> that's</c><00:41:21.670><c> kind</c><00:41:21.850><c> of</c><00:41:21.880><c> an</c>

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
college like so that's kind of an
 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
college like so that's kind of an

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:23.290 align:start position:0%

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:25.830 align:start position:0%
interesting and hard individual
trade-off<00:41:23.650><c> and</c><00:41:24.340><c> that</c><00:41:24.910><c> I</c><00:41:24.940><c> think</c><00:41:25.180><c> starts</c><00:41:25.570><c> to</c><00:41:25.690><c> get</c>

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
trade-off and that I think starts to get
 

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
trade-off and that I think starts to get
at<00:41:25.990><c> actually</c><00:41:26.410><c> like</c><00:41:26.620><c> what</c><00:41:26.920><c> what</c><00:41:27.430><c> is</c><00:41:27.550><c> the</c>

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:27.670 align:start position:0%
at actually like what what is the
 

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.010 align:start position:0%
at actually like what what is the

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:29.020 align:start position:0%

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.620 align:start position:0%

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:31.630 align:start position:0%
as a system because I think in a lot of
 

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
as a system because I think in a lot of

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.050 align:start position:0%
those cases it I think there are you

those cases it I think there are you

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
take a little bit more of a pragmatic
 

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
take a little bit more of a pragmatic
