figure that out it's not hard or you'll
 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.870 align:start position:0%
figure that out it's not hard or you'll
just<00:03:34.320><c> use</c><00:03:34.500><c> tools</c><00:03:34.739><c> that</c><00:03:34.860><c> will</c><00:03:35.070><c> make</c><00:03:35.220><c> that</c><00:03:35.370><c> a</c><00:03:35.580><c> lot</c>

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
just use tools that will make that a lot
 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.300 align:start position:0%
just use tools that will make that a lot
easier<00:03:36.209><c> for</c><00:03:36.420><c> you</c><00:03:36.570><c> so</c><00:03:37.500><c> that's</c><00:03:37.620><c> one</c><00:03:37.830><c> thing</c><00:03:38.040><c> that</c>

easier for you so that's one thing that

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
I thought I would do and so I picked
 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.699 align:start position:0%
I thought I would do and so I picked

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 align:start position:0%
pretty hard about like what the heck did
 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.229 align:start position:0%
pretty hard about like what the heck did

pare it down a little bit but I thought
 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
pare it down a little bit but I thought

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
make a mistake with yeah so from there I

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 align:start position:0%
thought that it'd also be helpful for
 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.129 align:start position:0%
thought that it'd also be helpful for
you<00:04:50.289><c> to</c><00:04:50.319><c> see</c><00:04:50.409><c> it</c><00:04:51.039><c> kind</c><00:04:51.490><c> of</c><00:04:51.580><c> broken</c><00:04:51.849><c> down</c><00:04:52.030><c> in</c><00:04:53.020><c> a</c>

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 align:start position:0%
you to see it kind of broken down in a
 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
you to see it kind of broken down in a
formula<00:04:53.620><c> and</c><00:04:54.370><c> so</c><00:04:54.520><c> this</c><00:04:54.669><c> is</c><00:04:54.789><c> the</c><00:04:54.879><c> formula</c><00:04:55.330><c> and</c><00:04:55.509><c> I</c>

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 align:start position:0%
formula and so this is the formula and I
 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.029 align:start position:0%
formula and so this is the formula and I
think<00:04:55.870><c> I</c><00:04:55.960><c> like</c><00:04:56.139><c> to</c><00:04:56.259><c> think</c><00:04:56.409><c> about</c><00:04:56.469><c> things</c><00:04:56.740><c> from</c>

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:22.810 align:start position:0%
something in a different country so you
 

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
something in a different country so you

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:24.310 align:start position:0%
should be able to assess any reason why
 

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to assess any reason why
you're<00:08:24.460><c> not</c><00:08:24.490><c> growing</c><00:08:24.820><c> just</c><00:08:25.390><c> starting</c><00:08:25.690><c> out</c>

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:25.810 align:start position:0%
you're not growing just starting out
 

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.029 align:start position:0%
you're not growing just starting out
with<00:08:25.900><c> that</c><00:08:26.080><c> and</c><00:08:26.200><c> that's</c><00:08:26.320><c> why</c><00:08:26.410><c> I</c><00:08:26.440><c> say</c><00:08:26.650><c> starting</c>

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
with that and that's why I say starting
 

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
with that and that's why I say starting
simple<00:08:27.570><c> will</c><00:08:28.570><c> last</c><00:08:28.750><c> a</c><00:08:28.900><c> very</c><00:08:28.930><c> long</c><00:08:29.200><c> time</c><00:08:29.970><c> so</c>

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:30.970 align:start position:0%
simple will last a very long time so
 

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.909 align:start position:0%
simple will last a very long time so
this<00:08:31.419><c> is</c><00:08:31.570><c> what</c><00:08:31.720><c> it</c><00:08:31.780><c> looks</c><00:08:31.960><c> like</c><00:08:32.020><c> right</c><00:08:32.560><c> linking</c>

the<00:13:31.260><c> real</c><00:13:31.440><c> question</c><00:13:31.770><c> is</c><00:13:32.300><c> you</c><00:13:33.300><c> know</c><00:13:33.420><c> great</c><00:13:33.930><c> so</c>

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:34.530 align:start position:0%
the real question is you know great so
 

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.550 align:start position:0%
the real question is you know great so
like<00:13:34.890><c> how</c><00:13:35.250><c> do</c><00:13:35.310><c> I</c><00:13:35.430><c> measure</c><00:13:36.200><c> how</c><00:13:37.200><c> did</c><00:13:37.380><c> you</c>

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
like how do I measure how did you
 

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:39.910 align:start position:0%
like how do I measure how did you
measure<00:13:37.800><c> whether</c><00:13:38.160><c> people</c><00:13:38.550><c> really</c><00:13:38.790><c> understood</c>

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
measure whether people really understood
 

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.780 align:start position:0%
measure whether people really understood
whether<00:13:40.920><c> they</c><00:13:41.070><c> understood</c><00:13:41.430><c> what</c><00:13:41.580><c> you</c><00:13:41.700><c> were</c>

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:41.790 align:start position:0%
whether they understood what you were
 

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.730 align:start position:0%
whether they understood what you were
doing<00:13:42.060><c> and</c><00:13:42.330><c> so</c><00:13:42.840><c> I</c><00:13:42.870><c> think</c><00:13:42.960><c> there's</c><00:13:43.170><c> like</c><00:13:43.350><c> one</c>

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
doing and so I think there's like one
 

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
doing and so I think there's like one
tried<00:13:44.160><c> and</c><00:13:44.370><c> trued</c><00:13:44.580><c> number</c><00:13:44.940><c> and</c><00:13:45.120><c> it's</c><00:13:45.210><c> like</c>

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:45.330 align:start position:0%
tried and trued number and it's like
 

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.270 align:start position:0%
tried and trued number and it's like
very<00:13:45.360><c> simple</c><00:13:45.780><c> it's</c><00:13:46.080><c> just</c><00:13:46.260><c> did</c><00:13:46.860><c> people</c><00:13:47.040><c> even</c>

a lot and then if you're in consumer the
 

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.470 align:start position:0%
a lot and then if you're in consumer the
benefit<00:15:11.070><c> of</c><00:15:11.160><c> being</c><00:15:11.310><c> in</c><00:15:11.430><c> consumer</c><00:15:11.940><c> is</c><00:15:12.120><c> that</c><00:15:12.330><c> you</c>

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
benefit of being in consumer is that you
 

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.020 align:start position:0%
benefit of being in consumer is that you

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.030 align:start position:0%
generally have usually will have like
 

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.150 align:start position:0%
generally have usually will have like
hundreds<00:15:15.420><c> or</c><00:15:15.570><c> thousands</c><00:15:15.990><c> of</c><00:15:16.080><c> users</c><00:15:16.320><c> such</c><00:15:16.980><c> that</c>

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds or thousands of users such that
 

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.340 align:start position:0%
hundreds or thousands of users such that
you<00:15:17.250><c> could</c><00:15:17.550><c> actually</c><00:15:18.210><c> go</c><00:15:18.600><c> do</c><00:15:18.810><c> an</c><00:15:18.930><c> a/b</c><00:15:19.020><c> test</c>

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:19.350 align:start position:0%
you could actually go do an a/b test
 

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.380 align:start position:0%
you could actually go do an a/b test
whereas<00:15:19.620><c> in</c><00:15:19.740><c> b2b</c><00:15:20.040><c> it's</c><00:15:20.280><c> a</c><00:15:20.490><c> lot</c><00:15:20.970><c> harder</c><00:15:21.240><c> to</c>

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:21.390 align:start position:0%
whereas in b2b it's a lot harder to
 

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.860 align:start position:0%
whereas in b2b it's a lot harder to
achieve<00:15:21.780><c> that</c><00:15:22.170><c> and</c><00:15:23.160><c> so</c><00:15:23.370><c> I</c><00:15:23.400><c> really</c><00:15:23.820><c> I</c><00:15:24.420><c> think</c>

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:24.870 align:start position:0%
achieve that and so I really I think
 

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.180 align:start position:0%
achieve that and so I really I think

Gustav is absolutely right that you
 

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:26.750 align:start position:0%

at this stage for the company and so it

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:13.230 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of work in and you have to
 

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.989 align:start position:0%

just ask them and I remember one time we
 

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.450 align:start position:0%
just ask them and I remember one time we
were<00:31:56.250><c> trying</c><00:31:56.549><c> to</c><00:31:56.610><c> redesign</c><00:31:57.030><c> our</c><00:31:57.480><c> funnel</c><00:31:57.960><c> UI</c>

00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:58.460 align:start position:0%
were trying to redesign our funnel UI
 

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.310 align:start position:0%
were trying to redesign our funnel UI
and<00:31:59.460><c> we</c><00:31:59.490><c> used</c><00:32:00.360><c> to</c><00:32:00.390><c> have</c><00:32:00.480><c> a</c><00:32:00.570><c> vertical</c><00:32:00.809><c> funnel</c>

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
and we used to have a vertical funnel
 

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
and we used to have a vertical funnel
but<00:32:02.010><c> we</c><00:32:02.100><c> had</c><00:32:02.190><c> a</c><00:32:02.250><c> competitor</c><00:32:02.760><c> that</c><00:32:02.790><c> has</c><00:32:02.970><c> a</c>

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.090 align:start position:0%
but we had a competitor that has a
 

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
but we had a competitor that has a
horizontal<00:32:03.630><c> funnel</c><00:32:04.169><c> and</c><00:32:04.380><c> it</c><00:32:04.770><c> seemed</c><00:32:05.010><c> like</c>

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:05.250 align:start position:0%
horizontal funnel and it seemed like
 

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.710 align:start position:0%
horizontal funnel and it seemed like
that<00:32:05.429><c> was</c><00:32:05.549><c> a</c><00:32:05.610><c> better</c><00:32:05.850><c> idea</c><00:32:06.030><c> it</c><00:32:06.390><c> seemed</c><00:32:06.570><c> like</c>

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
that was a better idea it seemed like
 

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
that was a better idea it seemed like
that<00:32:06.809><c> was</c><00:32:06.960><c> more</c><00:32:07.169><c> intuitive</c><00:32:07.679><c> for</c><00:32:08.070><c> customers</c>

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:08.490 align:start position:0%
that was more intuitive for customers
 

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.669 align:start position:0%
that was more intuitive for customers
and<00:32:08.700><c> so</c><00:32:09.299><c> I</c><00:32:09.600><c> didn't</c><00:32:09.870><c> really</c><00:32:09.960><c> know</c><00:32:10.230><c> how</c><00:32:10.410><c> to</c><00:32:10.470><c> like</c>

00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't really know how to like
 

00:32:10.679 --> 00:32:12.260 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't really know how to like
get<00:32:10.830><c> the</c><00:32:10.860><c> data</c><00:32:11.160><c> cuz</c><00:32:11.400><c> like</c><00:32:11.580><c> how</c><00:32:11.880><c> was</c><00:32:12.000><c> I</c><00:32:12.090><c> really</c>

get the data cuz like how was I really
 

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.909 align:start position:0%
get the data cuz like how was I really
gonna<00:32:12.390><c> find</c><00:32:12.660><c> out</c><00:32:12.809><c> whether</c><00:32:12.960><c> they</c><00:32:13.110><c> liked</c><00:32:13.350><c> one</c><00:32:13.830><c> of</c>

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
a/b test on that feature there's no real
 

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:23.850 align:start position:0%
way to realistic way to do that and so
 

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:25.490 align:start position:0%
way to realistic way to do that and so
all<00:32:24.059><c> I</c><00:32:24.090><c> did</c><00:32:24.240><c> was</c><00:32:24.480><c> I</c><00:32:24.600><c> just</c><00:32:24.660><c> made</c><00:32:24.929><c> like</c><00:32:25.110><c> a</c><00:32:25.200><c> really</c>

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:27.390 align:start position:0%
crappy version of the UI that I thought
 

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.090 align:start position:0%
crappy version of the UI that I thought
would<00:32:27.510><c> be</c><00:32:27.630><c> better</c><00:32:27.780><c> the</c><00:32:28.169><c> horizontal</c><00:32:28.740><c> version</c>

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
would be better the horizontal version
 

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.460 align:start position:0%
would be better the horizontal version

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
get really sophisticated that's when you
 

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.940 align:start position:0%
get really sophisticated that's when you

that and measure it over a funnel but
 

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.490 align:start position:0%
that and measure it over a funnel but

keep things really simple and then the
 

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.530 align:start position:0%
keep things really simple and then the

00:42:36.529 --> 00:42:36.539 align:start position:0%
or you or you ask them then you kind of
 

00:42:36.539 --> 00:42:38.450 align:start position:0%
or you or you ask them then you kind of
have<00:42:36.749><c> like</c><00:42:36.900><c> new</c><00:42:37.079><c> information</c><00:42:37.650><c> and</c><00:42:38.339><c> then</c><00:42:38.430><c> I</c>

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
have like new information and then I
 

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.130 align:start position:0%
have like new information and then I
think<00:42:38.609><c> the</c><00:42:38.700><c> key</c><00:42:38.880><c> is</c><00:42:38.999><c> to</c><00:42:39.029><c> find</c><00:42:39.420><c> the</c><00:42:39.599><c> minimum</c>

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
think the key is to find the minimum
 

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.289 align:start position:0%

would<00:44:45.220><c> you</c><00:44:45.310><c> do</c><00:44:45.430><c> that</c><00:44:45.570><c> and</c><00:44:46.570><c> my</c><00:44:46.720><c> hypothesis</c><00:44:47.350><c> was</c>

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:47.380 align:start position:0%
would you do that and my hypothesis was
 

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.110 align:start position:0%
would you do that and my hypothesis was
they<00:44:48.040><c> were</c><00:44:48.100><c> just</c><00:44:48.190><c> curious</c><00:44:48.550><c> like</c><00:44:48.820><c> what</c><00:44:49.000><c> the</c>

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
they were just curious like what the
 

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.570 align:start position:0%
they were just curious like what the

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:51.580 align:start position:0%
product did what is it that they did and
 

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.970 align:start position:0%
product did what is it that they did and
so<00:44:52.120><c> we</c><00:44:52.720><c> did</c><00:44:52.870><c> this</c><00:44:52.960><c> a</c><00:44:53.140><c> B</c><00:44:53.200><c> test</c><00:44:53.470><c> where</c><00:44:53.740><c> we</c><00:44:53.830><c> like</c>

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:53.980 align:start position:0%

you<00:45:30.860><c> run</c><00:45:31.160><c> the</c><00:45:31.190><c> experiment</c><00:45:32.030><c> to</c><00:45:32.750><c> develop</c><00:45:33.230><c> a</c>

you run the experiment to develop a

hypothesis ie the art not the science
and<00:45:36.890><c> then</c><00:45:37.250><c> measure</c><00:45:37.730><c> it</c><00:45:37.970><c> which</c><00:45:38.210><c> is</c><00:45:38.330><c> the</c><00:45:38.450><c> science</c>

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:40.270 align:start position:0%
and then measure it which is the science
to<00:45:38.930><c> find</c><00:45:39.080><c> out</c><00:45:39.320><c> whether</c><00:45:39.560><c> the</c><00:45:39.740><c> thing</c><00:45:39.980><c> that</c><00:45:40.190><c> you</c>

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
to find out whether the thing that you
 

00:45:40.280 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
to find out whether the thing that you
thought<00:45:40.550><c> of</c><00:45:40.790><c> was</c><00:45:41.690><c> in</c><00:45:41.780><c> fact</c><00:45:41.930><c> right</c><00:45:59.380><c> the</c><00:46:00.380><c> a</c>

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:00.410 align:start position:0%
thought of was in fact right the a
 

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:17.740 align:start position:0%
thought of was in fact right the a
percent<00:46:00.710><c> loss</c><00:46:00.860><c> in</c><00:46:01.010><c> revenue</c><00:46:01.100><c> over</c><00:46:01.640><c> a</c><00:46:01.670><c> year</c><00:46:16.750><c> yeah</c>

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
percent loss in revenue over a year yeah
 

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.140 align:start position:0%
percent loss in revenue over a year yeah
so<00:46:18.080><c> what</c><00:46:18.950><c> these</c><00:46:19.280><c> are</c><00:46:19.430><c> slightly</c><00:46:19.730><c> two</c><00:46:19.910><c> different</c>

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:20.150 align:start position:0%
so what these are slightly two different
 

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:24.250 align:start position:0%
so what these are slightly two different
things<00:46:20.240><c> one</c><00:46:20.390><c> is</c><00:46:20.980><c> one</c><00:46:21.980><c> is</c><00:46:22.130><c> like</c><00:46:22.400><c> user</c><00:46:23.360><c> retention</c>

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:24.260 align:start position:0%
things one is one is like user retention
 

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:27.490 align:start position:0%
things one is one is like user retention
and<00:46:24.590><c> then</c><00:46:24.710><c> one</c><00:46:24.830><c> is</c><00:46:24.980><c> like</c><00:46:25.160><c> dollar</c><00:46:25.670><c> churn</c><00:46:26.660><c> and</c><00:46:26.900><c> so</c>

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:27.500 align:start position:0%
and then one is like dollar churn and so
 

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.140 align:start position:0%
and then one is like dollar churn and so
in<00:46:27.860><c> the</c><00:46:27.950><c> case</c><00:46:28.130><c> of</c><00:46:28.310><c> dollar</c><00:46:28.490><c> turn</c><00:46:28.760><c> like</c><00:46:28.970><c> the</c>

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:29.150 align:start position:0%
in the case of dollar turn like the
 

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:30.490 align:start position:0%
in the case of dollar turn like the
reason<00:46:29.300><c> I</c><00:46:29.450><c> bring</c><00:46:29.570><c> up</c><00:46:29.690><c> dollar</c><00:46:29.900><c> turn</c><00:46:30.170><c> is</c><00:46:30.350><c> that</c>

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:30.500 align:start position:0%
reason I bring up dollar turn is that
 

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.690 align:start position:0%
reason I bring up dollar turn is that
even<00:46:30.740><c> like</c><00:46:30.980><c> you</c><00:46:31.130><c> could</c><00:46:31.280><c> totally</c><00:46:31.430><c> have</c><00:46:31.670><c> a</c>

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:31.700 align:start position:0%
even like you could totally have a
 

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.810 align:start position:0%
even like you could totally have a
company<00:46:32.090><c> where</c><00:46:33.070><c> nobody</c><00:46:34.070><c> uses</c><00:46:34.340><c> the</c><00:46:34.460><c> product</c>

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:34.820 align:start position:0%
company where nobody uses the product
 

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.670 align:start position:0%
company where nobody uses the product
and<00:46:35.000><c> the</c><00:46:35.390><c> company</c><00:46:35.750><c> continues</c><00:46:36.200><c> to</c><00:46:36.320><c> keep</c><00:46:36.440><c> paying</c>

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
and the company continues to keep paying
 

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.130 align:start position:0%
and the company continues to keep paying
for<00:46:36.740><c> it</c><00:46:36.980><c> right</c><00:46:37.390><c> but</c><00:46:38.390><c> I</c><00:46:38.450><c> find</c><00:46:38.690><c> that</c><00:46:38.750><c> like</c><00:46:38.900><c> most</c>

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:39.140 align:start position:0%
for it right but I find that like most
 

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:40.750 align:start position:0%
for it right but I find that like most
companies<00:46:39.410><c> are</c><00:46:39.740><c> like</c><00:46:39.890><c> pretty</c><00:46:40.100><c> incentivized</c>

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:38.830 align:start position:0%
of like unbelievable whereas um you know
 

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
of like unbelievable whereas um you know
like<00:47:39.830><c> a</c><00:47:39.920><c> product</c><00:47:40.250><c> like</c><00:47:40.340><c> mix</c><00:47:40.550><c> panel</c><00:47:40.790><c> when</c><00:47:40.880><c> we</c>

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:40.970 align:start position:0%
like a product like mix panel when we
 

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.820 align:start position:0%
like a product like mix panel when we
first<00:47:41.180><c> started</c><00:47:41.480><c> out</c><00:47:41.570><c> like</c><00:47:41.810><c> the</c><00:47:41.960><c> first</c><00:47:42.260><c> year</c><00:47:42.800><c> I</c>

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:42.830 align:start position:0%
first started out like the first year I
 

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:45.370 align:start position:0%
first started out like the first year I
think<00:47:42.980><c> we</c><00:47:43.190><c> had</c><00:47:43.310><c> like</c><00:47:43.340><c> 30</c><00:47:44.270><c> 40</c><00:47:44.600><c> percent</c><00:47:44.930><c> you</c><00:47:45.260><c> know</c>

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:45.380 align:start position:0%
think we had like 30 40 percent you know
 

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
think we had like 30 40 percent you know
retention<00:47:45.950><c> and</c><00:47:46.130><c> that's</c><00:47:46.580><c> not</c><00:47:46.700><c> that</c><00:47:46.790><c> great</c><00:47:47.290><c> but</c>

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:48.290 align:start position:0%
retention and that's not that great but
 

00:47:48.290 --> 00:48:02.470 align:start position:0%
retention and that's not that great but
who's<00:47:48.590><c> their</c><00:47:48.710><c> first</c><00:47:48.890><c> few</c><00:47:49.040><c> years</c><00:47:49.160><c> yeah</c><00:48:01.180><c> yeah</c><00:48:02.180><c> so</c>

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
who's their first few years yeah yeah so
 

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.780 align:start position:0%
who's their first few years yeah yeah so
a<00:48:02.510><c> question</c><00:48:02.900><c> is</c><00:48:03.020><c> are</c><00:48:03.500><c> these</c><00:48:03.710><c> metrics</c><00:48:04.280><c> can</c><00:48:04.640><c> they</c>

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:04.790 align:start position:0%
a question is are these metrics can they
 

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
a question is are these metrics can they
be<00:48:04.850><c> used</c><00:48:05.210><c> for</c><00:48:05.960><c> hardware</c><00:48:06.470><c> startup</c><00:48:06.830><c> yeah</c><00:48:07.340><c> I</c>

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:07.370 align:start position:0%
be used for hardware startup yeah I
 

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:09.130 align:start position:0%
be used for hardware startup yeah I
don't<00:48:07.520><c> I</c><00:48:07.700><c> don't</c><00:48:07.760><c> see</c><00:48:07.970><c> any</c><00:48:08.120><c> reason</c><00:48:08.390><c> why</c><00:48:08.510><c> we</c>

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:09.140 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see any reason why we
 

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:11.470 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see any reason why we
worked<00:48:09.380><c> with</c><00:48:09.620><c> jawbone</c><00:48:10.190><c> for</c><00:48:10.640><c> a</c><00:48:10.670><c> long</c><00:48:10.820><c> time</c><00:48:11.030><c> and</c>

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
worked with jawbone for a long time and
 

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
worked with jawbone for a long time and
we<00:48:12.080><c> work</c><00:48:12.230><c> with</c><00:48:12.380><c> Fitbit</c><00:48:12.910><c> and</c><00:48:13.910><c> most</c><00:48:14.900><c> hardware</c>

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:15.790 align:start position:0%
we work with Fitbit and most hardware
 

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
we work with Fitbit and most hardware
does<00:48:16.790><c> your</c><00:48:16.940><c> cart</c><00:48:17.150><c> hardware</c><00:48:17.510><c> company</c><00:48:17.780><c> have</c><00:48:17.900><c> a</c>

does your cart hardware company have a
 

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:25.690 align:start position:0%
does your cart hardware company have a

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:25.700 align:start position:0%
software component to it okay so it's a
 

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.460 align:start position:0%
software component to it okay so it's a
hardware<00:48:25.970><c> company</c><00:48:26.270><c> with</c><00:48:26.600><c> subscription</c><00:48:27.230><c> model</c>

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:29.710 align:start position:0%
hardware company with subscription model
yeah<00:48:27.970><c> yeah</c><00:48:28.970><c> absolutely</c>

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah absolutely
 

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah absolutely
it<00:48:29.870><c> may</c><00:48:30.020><c> be</c><00:48:30.080><c> more</c><00:48:30.320><c> challenging</c><00:48:30.380><c> as</c><00:48:31.010><c> a</c><00:48:31.040><c> hardware</c>

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:31.370 align:start position:0%
it may be more challenging as a hardware
 

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.460 align:start position:0%
it may be more challenging as a hardware
company<00:48:31.700><c> to</c><00:48:31.820><c> track</c><00:48:32.000><c> but</c><00:48:32.690><c> it's</c><00:48:32.810><c> like</c><00:48:32.960><c> sometimes</c>

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:33.470 align:start position:0%
company to track but it's like sometimes
 

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.250 align:start position:0%
company to track but it's like sometimes
but<00:48:33.920><c> it's</c><00:48:34.040><c> totally</c><00:48:34.190><c> doable</c><00:48:34.750><c> most</c><00:48:35.750><c> hardware</c><00:48:36.170><c> is</c>

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:36.260 align:start position:0%
but it's totally doable most hardware is
 

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.780 align:start position:0%
but it's totally doable most hardware is
like<00:48:36.410><c> connected</c><00:48:37.130><c> to</c><00:48:37.220><c> the</c><00:48:37.280><c> internet</c><00:48:37.580><c> somehow</c>

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:37.790 align:start position:0%
like connected to the internet somehow
 

00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:39.430 align:start position:0%
like connected to the internet somehow
so<00:48:38.120><c> I</c><00:48:38.150><c> don't</c><00:48:38.330><c> see</c><00:48:38.450><c> any</c><00:48:38.570><c> reason</c><00:48:38.870><c> why</c><00:48:38.900><c> like</c><00:48:39.230><c> a</c><00:48:39.260><c> lot</c>

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any reason why like a lot
 

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't see any reason why like a lot
of<00:48:39.470><c> the</c><00:48:39.620><c> scooter</c><00:48:39.830><c> companies</c><00:48:40.220><c> for</c><00:48:40.490><c> example</c>

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:40.930 align:start position:0%
of the scooter companies for example
 

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:43.060 align:start position:0%
of the scooter companies for example
they're<00:48:41.930><c> like</c><00:48:42.110><c> all</c><00:48:42.230><c> connected</c><00:48:42.680><c> to</c><00:48:42.770><c> hardware</c>

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:43.070 align:start position:0%
they're like all connected to hardware
 

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:44.410 align:start position:0%
they're like all connected to hardware
and<00:48:43.220><c> they</c><00:48:43.280><c> have</c><00:48:43.370><c> a</c><00:48:43.430><c> software</c><00:48:43.700><c> component</c><00:48:43.880><c> so</c>

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:44.420 align:start position:0%
and they have a software component so
 

00:48:44.420 --> 00:49:14.870 align:start position:0%
and they have a software component so
there's<00:48:45.080><c> really</c><00:48:45.200><c> no</c><00:48:45.380><c> difference</c>

and<00:49:32.500><c> stuff</c><00:49:32.700><c> and</c><00:49:33.700><c> how</c><00:49:34.360><c> do</c><00:49:34.990><c> you</c><00:49:35.140><c> figure</c><00:49:35.380><c> out</c><00:49:35.500><c> like</c>

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
and stuff and how do you figure out like
 

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.830 align:start position:0%
and stuff and how do you figure out like
what<00:49:36.130><c> to</c><00:49:36.250><c> do</c><00:49:36.400><c> basically</c><00:49:36.970><c> from</c><00:49:37.270><c> that</c><00:49:37.330><c> point</c><00:49:37.690><c> to</c>

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
what to do basically from that point to
 

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
what to do basically from that point to
the<00:49:37.930><c> next</c><00:49:38.020><c> point</c><00:49:38.700><c> yeah</c><00:49:39.700><c> so</c><00:49:39.970><c> I</c><00:49:40.000><c> think</c><00:49:40.090><c> that</c><00:49:40.330><c> the</c>

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:40.510 align:start position:0%
the next point yeah so I think that the
 

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.930 align:start position:0%
the next point yeah so I think that the
basic<00:49:40.750><c> gist</c><00:49:41.200><c> is</c><00:49:41.440><c> that</c><00:49:41.470><c> so</c><00:49:42.370><c> you</c><00:49:42.460><c> can</c><00:49:42.580><c> clearly</c>

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:42.940 align:start position:0%
basic gist is that so you can clearly
 

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
basic gist is that so you can clearly
see<00:49:43.060><c> like</c><00:49:43.270><c> I</c><00:49:43.330><c> had</c><00:49:43.450><c> no</c><00:49:43.720><c> idea</c><00:49:43.750><c> who</c><00:49:44.350><c> our</c><00:49:44.380><c> customers</c>

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:44.950 align:start position:0%
see like I had no idea who our customers
 

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:48.210 align:start position:0%
see like I had no idea who our customers
were<00:49:45.100><c> and</c><00:49:45.340><c> then</c><00:49:45.790><c> after</c><00:49:46.150><c> like</c><00:49:46.300><c> a</c><00:49:46.330><c> few</c><00:49:46.540><c> years</c><00:49:47.220><c> you</c>

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:48.220 align:start position:0%
were and then after like a few years you
 

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
were and then after like a few years you
just<00:49:48.250><c> you</c><00:49:48.610><c> talk</c><00:49:48.850><c> to</c><00:49:49.030><c> users</c><00:49:49.360><c> you</c><00:49:49.660><c> ask</c><00:49:49.870><c> them</c><00:49:50.170><c> like</c>

00:50:40.439 --> 00:50:40.449 align:start position:0%
most of the time I would always employ
 

00:50:40.449 --> 00:50:41.910 align:start position:0%
most of the time I would always employ
this<00:50:40.599><c> trick</c><00:50:40.900><c> where</c><00:50:41.079><c> I</c><00:50:41.109><c> would</c><00:50:41.289><c> just</c><00:50:41.410><c> I</c><00:50:41.619><c> would</c>

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
this trick where I would just I would
 

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:43.349 align:start position:0%
this trick where I would just I would
charge<00:50:42.189><c> the</c><00:50:42.400><c> money</c><00:50:42.549><c> for</c><00:50:42.819><c> it</c><00:50:42.910><c> and</c><00:50:43.059><c> then</c><00:50:43.150><c> if</c><00:50:43.269><c> they</c>

00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
charge the money for it and then if they
 

00:50:43.359 --> 00:50:44.670 align:start position:0%
charge the money for it and then if they
said<00:50:43.569><c> no</c><00:50:43.749><c> I</c><00:50:43.779><c> would</c><00:50:44.049><c> just</c><00:50:44.079><c> give</c><00:50:44.259><c> it</c><00:50:44.349><c> to</c><00:50:44.439><c> them</c><00:50:44.559><c> for</c>

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
said no I would just give it to them for
 

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.229 align:start position:0%
said no I would just give it to them for
free<00:50:44.859><c> because</c><00:50:45.279><c> the</c><00:50:45.369><c> feedback</c><00:50:45.729><c> was</c><00:50:46.059><c> more</c>

00:50:46.229 --> 00:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
free because the feedback was more
 

00:50:46.239 --> 00:50:47.459 align:start position:0%
free because the feedback was more
important<00:50:46.660><c> but</c><00:50:46.779><c> I</c><00:50:46.839><c> always</c><00:50:46.930><c> wanted</c><00:50:47.199><c> to</c><00:50:47.289><c> see</c><00:50:47.410><c> if</c>

00:50:47.459 --> 00:50:47.469 align:start position:0%
important but I always wanted to see if
 

00:50:47.469 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
important but I always wanted to see if
they<00:50:47.589><c> would</c><00:50:47.769><c> pay</c><00:50:47.979><c> for</c><00:50:48.039><c> it</c><00:50:48.309><c> and</c><00:50:48.489><c> so</c><00:50:49.119><c> the</c><00:50:49.719><c> only</c>

00:50:49.799 --> 00:50:49.809 align:start position:0%
they would pay for it and so the only
 

00:50:49.809 --> 00:50:50.729 align:start position:0%
they would pay for it and so the only
people<00:50:49.959><c> that</c><00:50:50.049><c> are</c><00:50:50.170><c> willing</c><00:50:50.380><c> to</c><00:50:50.439><c> do</c><00:50:50.529><c> that</c><00:50:50.650><c> are</c>

00:50:50.729 --> 00:50:50.739 align:start position:0%
people that are willing to do that are
 

00:50:50.739 --> 00:50:53.969 align:start position:0%
people that are willing to do that are

like not different is whether you have
 

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.499 align:start position:0%
like not different is whether you have

00:52:01.499 --> 00:52:01.509 align:start position:0%
forgot about password right that was
 

00:52:01.509 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
forgot about password right that was
like<00:52:01.630><c> in</c><00:52:01.749><c> the</c><00:52:01.869><c> bucket</c><00:52:02.140><c> of</c><00:52:02.229><c> things</c><00:52:02.439><c> that</c><00:52:02.559><c> like</c>

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:02.650 align:start position:0%
like in the bucket of things that like
 

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
like in the bucket of things that like
maybe<00:52:02.920><c> don't</c><00:52:03.189><c> matter</c><00:52:03.369><c> and</c><00:52:03.640><c> so</c><00:52:04.209><c> I</c><00:52:04.239><c> think</c><00:52:04.420><c> the</c>

00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:04.569 align:start position:0%
maybe don't matter and so I think the
 

00:52:04.569 --> 00:52:06.269 align:start position:0%
maybe don't matter and so I think the
question<00:52:04.689><c> is</c><00:52:04.929><c> like</c><00:52:05.049><c> really</c><00:52:05.259><c> like</c><00:52:05.439><c> when</c><00:52:06.130><c> does</c>

00:52:06.269 --> 00:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
question is like really like when does
 

00:52:06.279 --> 00:52:07.829 align:start position:0%
question is like really like when does
it<00:52:06.369><c> become</c><00:52:06.640><c> a</c><00:52:06.670><c> problem</c><00:52:06.910><c> enough</c><00:52:07.269><c> for</c><00:52:07.479><c> you</c><00:52:07.630><c> that</c>

it become a problem enough for you that

00:52:10.049 --> 00:52:10.059 align:start position:0%
it's worth building right like if you if

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
start then you should just build that
 

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
start then you should just build that
feature<00:52:21.460><c> because</c><00:52:22.390><c> you</c><00:52:22.660><c> know</c><00:52:22.870><c> that</c><00:52:23.080><c> if</c><00:52:23.200><c> you</c>

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:23.290 align:start position:0%
feature because you know that if you
 

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.630 align:start position:0%
feature because you know that if you
don't<00:52:23.440><c> build</c><00:52:23.680><c> a</c><00:52:23.710><c> feature</c><00:52:23.830><c> they</c><00:52:24.250><c> can't</c><00:52:24.460><c> login</c>

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
don't build a feature they can't login
 

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.250 align:start position:0%
don't build a feature they can't login
then<00:52:25.120><c> you</c><00:52:25.240><c> can't</c><00:52:25.450><c> retain</c><00:52:25.720><c> them</c><00:52:25.960><c> and</c><00:52:26.080><c> then</c><00:52:26.200><c> you</c>

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:26.260 align:start position:0%
then you can't retain them and then you
 

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.230 align:start position:0%
then you can't retain them and then you
lose<00:52:26.440><c> them</c><00:52:26.650><c> so</c><00:52:27.220><c> it</c><00:52:27.520><c> becomes</c><00:52:27.850><c> this</c><00:52:28.060><c> like</c>

00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
lose them so it becomes this like
 

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.970 align:start position:0%
lose them so it becomes this like

you've all done this like with a bank or
 

00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:04.260 align:start position:0%
you've all done this like with a bank or
something<00:53:03.070><c> like</c><00:53:03.220><c> I'll</c><00:53:03.460><c> just</c><00:53:03.520><c> do</c><00:53:03.700><c> it</c><00:53:03.790><c> tomorrow</c>

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:04.270 align:start position:0%
something like I'll just do it tomorrow
 

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
something like I'll just do it tomorrow
you<00:53:04.660><c> know</c><00:53:04.750><c> you</c><00:53:04.810><c> don't</c><00:53:05.020><c> even</c><00:53:05.200><c> bother</c><00:53:05.320><c> right</c><00:53:06.280><c> and</c>

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:06.610 align:start position:0%
you know you don't even bother right and
 

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:08.430 align:start position:0%
you know you don't even bother right and
so<00:53:06.940><c> it</c><00:53:07.030><c> turns</c><00:53:07.240><c> out</c><00:53:07.450><c> that</c><00:53:07.570><c> even</c><00:53:07.840><c> that</c><00:53:07.960><c> happens</c>

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
so it turns out that even that happens
 

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
so it turns out that even that happens
and<00:53:08.770><c> so</c><00:53:08.890><c> we</c><00:53:09.010><c> went</c><00:53:09.190><c> so</c><00:53:09.400><c> far</c><00:53:09.670><c> even</c><00:53:10.030><c> though</c><00:53:10.090><c> we</c>

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:10.210 align:start position:0%
and so we went so far even though we
 

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
and so we went so far even though we

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:12.610 align:start position:0%
didn't do that I like to think that like
 

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
didn't do that I like to think that like

we really made up for this later on we
 

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
we really made up for this later on we

00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:43.140 align:start position:0%
and I think that you can you can totally
 

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.830 align:start position:0%
and I think that you can you can totally
measure<00:54:43.350><c> that</c><00:54:43.620><c> by</c><00:54:44.160><c> how</c><00:54:44.400><c> they</c><00:54:44.580><c> use</c><00:54:44.820><c> it</c><00:54:45.030><c> and</c><00:54:45.240><c> so</c><00:54:45.810><c> I</c>

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
measure that by how they use it and so I
 

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
measure that by how they use it and so I
think<00:54:45.930><c> the</c><00:54:46.110><c> quantitative</c><00:54:46.620><c> measurement</c><00:54:47.040><c> is</c>

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:47.450 align:start position:0%
think the quantitative measurement is
 

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.700 align:start position:0%
think the quantitative measurement is
basically<00:54:48.450><c> finding</c><00:54:48.780><c> like</c><00:54:48.960><c> some</c><00:54:49.170><c> benchmark</c>

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:49.710 align:start position:0%
basically finding like some benchmark
 

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.100 align:start position:0%
basically finding like some benchmark
some<00:54:50.370><c> sense</c><00:54:50.640><c> that</c><00:54:50.730><c> for</c><00:54:50.940><c> your</c><00:54:51.090><c> industry</c><00:54:51.360><c> maybe</c>

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:52.110 align:start position:0%
some sense that for your industry maybe
 

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:53.210 align:start position:0%
some sense that for your industry maybe
that's<00:54:52.290><c> like</c><00:54:52.380><c> thirty</c><00:54:52.620><c> percent</c><00:54:52.920><c> and</c><00:54:53.010><c> just</c>

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
that's like thirty percent and just
 

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.980 align:start position:0%
that's like thirty percent and just
remember<00:54:53.520><c> like</c><00:54:53.670><c> that</c><00:54:54.120><c> benchmark</c><00:54:54.420><c> is</c><00:54:54.720><c> probably</c>

00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:54.990 align:start position:0%
remember like that benchmark is probably
 

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:56.930 align:start position:0%
remember like that benchmark is probably
like<00:54:55.140><c> average</c><00:54:55.620><c> and</c><00:54:56.130><c> your</c><00:54:56.370><c> desires</c><00:54:56.700><c> to</c>

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
like average and your desires to
 

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.060 align:start position:0%
like average and your desires to
basically<00:54:57.210><c> be</c><00:54:57.390><c> above</c><00:54:57.630><c> average</c><00:54:57.780><c> and</c><00:54:58.200><c> so</c><00:54:58.680><c> if</c><00:54:58.950><c> you</c>

00:54:59.060 --> 00:54:59.070 align:start position:0%
basically be above average and so if you
 

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
basically be above average and so if you
can<00:54:59.250><c> like</c><00:54:59.370><c> significantly</c><00:55:00.150><c> beat</c><00:55:00.420><c> that</c>

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:00.570 align:start position:0%
can like significantly beat that
 

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.050 align:start position:0%
can like significantly beat that
benchmark<00:55:01.400><c> then</c><00:55:02.400><c> I</c><00:55:02.430><c> think</c><00:55:02.610><c> that</c><00:55:02.730><c> you've</c><00:55:02.880><c> like</c>

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
benchmark then I think that you've like
 

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.150 align:start position:0%
benchmark then I think that you've like
really<00:55:03.510><c> you've</c><00:55:03.840><c> you've</c><00:55:04.230><c> done</c><00:55:04.710><c> better</c><00:55:04.980><c> than</c>

00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
really you've you've done better than
 

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
really you've you've done better than
probably<00:55:05.340><c> product</c><00:55:05.790><c> market</c><00:55:06.060><c> fit</c><00:55:06.090><c> I</c><00:55:07.050><c> think</c>

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:07.410 align:start position:0%
probably product market fit I think
 

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.780 align:start position:0%
probably product market fit I think
that's<00:55:07.620><c> one</c><00:55:07.800><c> thing</c><00:55:08.010><c> I</c><00:55:08.160><c> think</c><00:55:08.400><c> another</c><00:55:08.580><c> thing</c>

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:08.790 align:start position:0%
that's one thing I think another thing
 

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:10.550 align:start position:0%
that's one thing I think another thing
is<00:55:08.910><c> like</c><00:55:09.120><c> you</c><00:55:09.570><c> can</c><00:55:09.690><c> try</c><00:55:09.870><c> to</c><00:55:09.930><c> measure</c><00:55:10.140><c> like</c>

00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
is like you can try to measure like
 

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.860 align:start position:0%
is like you can try to measure like
overall<00:55:10.980><c> like</c>

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:11.870 align:start position:0%
overall like
 

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:14.270 align:start position:0%
overall like

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
repetitive use like frequent use in a
 

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.820 align:start position:0%
repetitive use like frequent use in a
