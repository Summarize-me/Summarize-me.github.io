00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
talk about four different things that we
 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.950 align:start position:0%
talk about four different things that we
can<00:04:34.560><c> do</c>

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
can do

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
those four horsemen
 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.070 align:start position:0%
those four horsemen
the<00:04:39.040><c> first</c><00:04:39.360><c> one</c><00:04:39.600><c> is</c><00:04:40.080><c> divide</c><00:04:41.040><c> and</c><00:04:41.280><c> conquer</c>

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
the first one is divide and conquer
 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.909 align:start position:0%
the first one is divide and conquer
and<00:04:42.560><c> this</c><00:04:42.880><c> feels</c><00:04:43.199><c> pretty</c><00:04:43.360><c> straightforward</c>

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
and this feels pretty straightforward
 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.670 align:start position:0%
and this feels pretty straightforward

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.510 align:start position:0%
early stages of the start
let's<00:04:57.440><c> say</c><00:04:57.919><c> adora</c><00:04:58.479><c> and</c><00:04:58.639><c> i</c><00:04:59.120><c> are</c><00:04:59.280><c> doing</c><00:04:59.440><c> a</c>

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
let's say adora and i are doing a
 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.430 align:start position:0%
let's say adora and i are doing a
startup<00:04:59.759><c> together</c><00:05:00.080><c> it's</c><00:05:00.240><c> just</c><00:05:00.560><c> her</c><00:05:00.720><c> and</c><00:05:00.880><c> me</c>

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
startup together it's just her and me
 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.110 align:start position:0%
startup together it's just her and me
then<00:05:01.759><c> what</c><00:05:02.000><c> you</c><00:05:02.080><c> want</c><00:05:02.240><c> to</c><00:05:02.320><c> do</c><00:05:02.560><c> is</c><00:05:02.639><c> just</c><00:05:02.800><c> kind</c><00:05:02.960><c> of</c>

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
then what you want to do is just kind of
 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.350 align:start position:0%
then what you want to do is just kind of
say<00:05:03.280><c> like</c><00:05:03.520><c> oh</c><00:05:04.080><c> who's</c><00:05:04.479><c> responsible</c>

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
say like oh who's responsible
 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.710 align:start position:0%
say like oh who's responsible
what<00:05:05.759><c> stuff</c><00:05:07.120><c> and</c><00:05:07.360><c> what</c><00:05:07.520><c> this</c><00:05:07.759><c> will</c><00:05:07.919><c> do</c><00:05:08.240><c> is</c><00:05:08.400><c> like</c>

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
what stuff and what this will do is like
 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.070 align:start position:0%
what stuff and what this will do is like
if<00:05:08.960><c> there's</c><00:05:09.280><c> a</c><00:05:09.440><c> problem</c>

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem
 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.790 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem
in<00:05:10.240><c> that</c><00:05:10.560><c> category</c><00:05:11.600><c> then</c><00:05:11.919><c> that</c><00:05:12.240><c> person</c><00:05:12.639><c> that</c>

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
in that category then that person that
 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.390 align:start position:0%
in that category then that person that
we<00:05:12.960><c> have</c><00:05:13.039><c> assigned</c><00:05:13.360><c> ahead</c><00:05:13.680><c> of</c><00:05:13.759><c> time</c>

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have assigned ahead of time
 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.790 align:start position:0%
we have assigned ahead of time
to<00:05:14.560><c> be</c><00:05:14.720><c> in</c><00:05:14.880><c> charge</c><00:05:15.840><c> will</c><00:05:16.000><c> be</c><00:05:16.160><c> the</c><00:05:16.320><c> ones</c><00:05:17.360><c> that</c>

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
to be in charge will be the ones that
 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.189 align:start position:0%
to be in charge will be the ones that
will<00:05:19.120><c> ultimately</c><00:05:19.919><c> either</c><00:05:20.240><c> make</c><00:05:20.400><c> the</c><00:05:20.560><c> decision</c>

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
will ultimately either make the decision
 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.110 align:start position:0%
will ultimately either make the decision
or<00:05:21.440><c> ultimately</c><00:05:21.919><c> are</c><00:05:22.080><c> responsible</c>

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
or ultimately are responsible
 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
or ultimately are responsible
this<00:05:23.440><c> protects</c><00:05:24.000><c> us</c><00:05:24.240><c> from</c><00:05:24.720><c> defensiveness</c>

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
this protects us from defensiveness
 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.469 align:start position:0%
this protects us from defensiveness
so<00:05:26.560><c> notice</c><00:05:26.960><c> here</c><00:05:27.120><c> on</c><00:05:27.280><c> jealousy</c><00:05:27.919><c> this</c><00:05:28.080><c> is</c><00:05:28.240><c> about</c>

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
is what is your attachment style
 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.350 align:start position:0%
is what is your attachment style

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
and basically it was determined that

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.630 align:start position:0%

what the decision was the date was done
 

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
what the decision was the date was done
and<00:12:09.200><c> then</c><00:12:09.440><c> rationale</c>

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
and then rationale
 

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.389 align:start position:0%
and then rationale
and<00:12:10.800><c> so</c><00:12:10.959><c> when</c><00:12:11.120><c> we</c><00:12:11.360><c> walk</c><00:12:11.600><c> through</c><00:12:11.760><c> this</c><00:12:12.000><c> process</c>

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
and so when we walk through this process
 

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:14.230 align:start position:0%
and so when we walk through this process
if<00:12:12.480><c> we've</c><00:12:12.639><c> decided</c><00:12:13.120><c> this</c><00:12:13.360><c> ahead</c><00:12:13.600><c> of</c><00:12:13.760><c> time</c>

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
if we've decided this ahead of time
 

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.710 align:start position:0%
if we've decided this ahead of time
then<00:12:14.399><c> it</c><00:12:14.480><c> means</c><00:12:14.800><c> that</c><00:12:15.040><c> we</c><00:12:15.279><c> are</c><00:12:15.440><c> not</c><00:12:15.760><c> afraid</c>

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
then it means that we are not afraid
