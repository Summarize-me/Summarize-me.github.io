a five percent difference there and that
 

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.870 align:start position:0%
a five percent difference there and that
would<00:13:08.940><c> actually</c><00:13:09.240><c> lead</c><00:13:09.839><c> to</c><00:13:10.200><c> only</c><00:13:10.500><c> 28</c><00:13:11.279><c> customers</c>

00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
at the end of that first year that's a
 

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:17.090 align:start position:0%
at the end of that first year that's a

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.270 align:start position:0%
time to maximize that the next Insight

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
is that you should price on value not on

is that you should price on value not on
cost

00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
cost
 

00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:46.610 align:start position:0%
cost
and<00:19:45.539><c> so</c><00:19:45.660><c> there's</c><00:19:45.900><c> three</c><00:19:46.140><c> important</c>

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
and so there's three important
 

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.310 align:start position:0%
and so there's three important

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
components here the first is the cost
 

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.190 align:start position:0%
components here the first is the cost
this<00:19:50.220><c> is</c><00:19:50.400><c> what</c><00:19:50.700><c> it</c><00:19:50.820><c> costs</c><00:19:51.240><c> you</c><00:19:51.480><c> to</c><00:19:51.720><c> be</c><00:19:51.840><c> able</c><00:19:51.960><c> to</c>

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
this is what it costs you to be able to
 

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.350 align:start position:0%
this is what it costs you to be able to
serve<00:19:52.559><c> your</c><00:19:52.740><c> customer</c><00:19:52.980><c> the</c><00:19:53.640><c> next</c><00:19:53.760><c> variable</c><00:19:54.179><c> is</c>

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
serve your customer the next variable is
 

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.630 align:start position:0%
serve your customer the next variable is
price<00:19:54.660><c> this</c><00:19:55.260><c> is</c><00:19:55.320><c> what</c><00:19:55.559><c> you're</c><00:19:55.679><c> charging</c>

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
price this is what you're charging
 

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.669 align:start position:0%
price this is what you're charging
and<00:19:57.179><c> then</c><00:19:57.299><c> there's</c><00:19:57.480><c> the</c><00:19:57.780><c> perceived</c><00:19:58.380><c> value</c>

00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
and then there's the perceived value
 

00:19:58.679 --> 00:20:01.190 align:start position:0%
and then there's the perceived value
that<00:19:59.580><c> your</c><00:19:59.820><c> customers</c><00:20:00.179><c> see</c><00:20:00.480><c> in</c><00:20:00.840><c> your</c><00:20:01.020><c> product</c>

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
that your customers see in your product
 

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.070 align:start position:0%
that your customers see in your product
and<00:20:01.919><c> so</c><00:20:02.039><c> Founders</c><00:20:02.580><c> often</c><00:20:03.120><c> start</c><00:20:03.419><c> with</c>

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
and so Founders often start with
 

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.350 align:start position:0%
and so Founders often start with
something<00:20:04.260><c> called</c><00:20:04.620><c> Cost</c><00:20:04.980><c> Plus</c><00:20:05.280><c> pricing</c><00:20:05.880><c> I</c>

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
something called Cost Plus pricing I
 

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.450 align:start position:0%
something called Cost Plus pricing I
would<00:20:06.480><c> not</c><00:20:06.660><c> recommend</c><00:20:07.140><c> this</c><00:20:07.860><c> what</c><00:20:08.340><c> this</c>
