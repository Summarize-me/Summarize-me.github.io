like you know maybe there's some common
 

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:42.550 align:start position:0%
like you know maybe there's some common
principles<00:09:40.480><c> but</c><00:09:40.640><c> like</c><00:09:40.959><c> in</c><00:09:41.120><c> general</c>

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
principles but like in general
 

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.310 align:start position:0%
principles but like in general
software<00:09:42.959><c> companies</c><00:09:43.360><c> look</c><00:09:43.600><c> really</c><00:09:43.920><c> different</c>

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
stage probably has some really broken
 

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.230 align:start position:0%
stage probably has some really broken
 that<00:11:50.320><c> has</c><00:11:50.480><c> to</c><00:11:50.560><c> be</c><00:11:50.639><c> dealt</c><00:11:50.880><c> with</c><00:11:51.279><c> and</c><00:11:51.440><c> so</c>

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
 that has to be dealt with and so
 

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.829 align:start position:0%
 that has to be dealt with and so
unfortunately

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
it's<00:11:54.000><c> harder</c><00:11:54.320><c> for</c><00:11:54.480><c> them</c><00:11:54.639><c> to</c><00:11:54.800><c> kind</c><00:11:54.959><c> of</c><00:11:55.040><c> go</c><00:11:55.600><c> and</c>

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's harder for them to kind of go and
 

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.430 align:start position:0%
it's harder for them to kind of go and
spend<00:11:56.240><c> the</c><00:11:56.320><c> time</c><00:11:56.560><c> in</c><00:11:56.639><c> the</c><00:11:56.720><c> dirt</c><00:11:56.959><c> with</c><00:11:57.120><c> you</c><00:11:57.279><c> on</c>

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%

because<00:11:58.639><c> it's</c><00:11:58.800><c> going</c><00:11:58.959><c> to</c><00:11:59.040><c> kind</c><00:11:59.200><c> of</c><00:11:59.279><c> break</c>

00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
because it's going to kind of break
 

00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:01.590 align:start position:0%
because it's going to kind of break
