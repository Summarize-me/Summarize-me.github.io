it<00:04:16.739><c> the</c><00:04:17.280><c> most</c><00:04:17.459><c> is</c><00:04:18.120><c> that</c><00:04:18.479><c> thing</c><00:04:19.380><c> companies</c><00:04:20.340><c> are</c>

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
it the most is that thing companies are
 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.129 align:start position:0%
it the most is that thing companies are
huge<00:04:21.060><c> now</c>

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
huge now
 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.730 align:start position:0%
huge now
and<00:04:22.919><c> so</c><00:04:23.300><c> the</c><00:04:24.300><c> workflow</c><00:04:24.780><c> the</c><00:04:25.139><c> decision</c><00:04:25.440><c> making</c>

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
and so the workflow the decision making
 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.249 align:start position:0%
and so the workflow the decision making
the<00:04:26.460><c> tools</c><00:04:26.820><c> the</c><00:04:27.180><c> support</c><00:04:27.419><c> that</c><00:04:27.960><c> a</c><00:04:28.080><c> Fang</c>

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 align:start position:0%
the tools the support that a Fang
 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.350 align:start position:0%
the tools the support that a Fang
engineer<00:04:28.800><c> has</c>

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
engineer has
 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.730 align:start position:0%
engineer has
um<00:04:30.419><c> needless</c><00:04:30.840><c> to</c><00:04:30.960><c> say</c><00:04:31.139><c> they</c><00:04:31.259><c> have</c><00:04:31.440><c> none</c><00:04:31.620><c> of</c>

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
um needless to say they have none of
 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.129 align:start position:0%
um needless to say they have none of
that<00:04:31.919><c> uh</c><00:04:32.639><c> when</c><00:04:32.880><c> they</c><00:04:33.060><c> come</c><00:04:33.240><c> to</c><00:04:33.419><c> your</c><00:04:33.660><c> startup</c>

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
that uh when they come to your startup
 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.469 align:start position:0%
that uh when they come to your startup
and<00:04:34.860><c> so</c><00:04:35.040><c> you</c><00:04:35.280><c> might</c><00:04:35.460><c> be</c><00:04:35.580><c> seeing</c><00:04:35.940><c> someone</c><00:04:36.120><c> who's</c>

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
and so you might be seeing someone who's
 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.969 align:start position:0%
and so you might be seeing someone who's
extremely<00:04:36.960><c> talented</c><00:04:37.440><c> but</c><00:04:37.620><c> extremely</c>

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
extremely talented but extremely
 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.070 align:start position:0%
extremely talented but extremely

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
talented in that system
 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.990 align:start position:0%
talented in that system
and<00:04:40.500><c> they</c><00:04:40.740><c> might</c><00:04:40.919><c> not</c><00:04:41.100><c> be</c><00:04:41.280><c> able</c><00:04:41.400><c> to</c><00:04:41.520><c> bring</c><00:04:41.759><c> the</c>

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
and they might not be able to bring the
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.330 align:start position:0%
and they might not be able to bring the
same<00:04:42.120><c> level</c><00:04:42.300><c> of</c><00:04:42.540><c> productivity</c><00:04:43.040><c> while</c><00:04:44.040><c> they</c>

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
same level of productivity while they
 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
same level of productivity while they
certainly<00:04:44.639><c> are</c><00:04:44.820><c> bringing</c><00:04:45.240><c> the</c><00:04:45.360><c> same</c><00:04:45.540><c> level</c><00:04:45.720><c> of</c>

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
certainly are bringing the same level of
 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.270 align:start position:0%
certainly are bringing the same level of
cost

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
cost
 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.610 align:start position:0%
cost
um<00:04:47.340><c> so</c><00:04:47.580><c> that</c><00:04:47.699><c> seems</c><00:04:48.060><c> like</c><00:04:48.180><c> a</c><00:04:48.419><c> killer</c><00:04:48.780><c> a</c><00:04:49.259><c> killer</c>

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
um so that seems like a killer a killer
 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.110 align:start position:0%
um so that seems like a killer a killer
one-two<00:04:50.100><c> punch</c><00:04:50.340><c> but</c><00:04:50.639><c> but</c><00:04:50.759><c> what</c><00:04:51.000><c> about</c>

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
like when we were coming up it was a bit

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
average startup had less money and so it
 

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.529 align:start position:0%
average startup had less money and so it
was<00:26:25.500><c> a</c><00:26:25.679><c> lot</c><00:26:25.799><c> easier</c><00:26:26.159><c> to</c><00:26:26.340><c> say</c><00:26:26.580><c> I</c><00:26:27.000><c> can't</c><00:26:27.299><c> spend</c>

00:26:27.529 --> 00:26:27.539 align:start position:0%
