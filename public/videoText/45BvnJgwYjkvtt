00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
I do now um and I think that you know
 

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.550 align:start position:0%
I do now um and I think that you know
breadth<00:17:19.970><c> first</c><00:17:20.330><c> and</c><00:17:20.720><c> then</c><00:17:20.870><c> increasingly</c>

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
breadth first and then increasingly

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:25.070 align:start position:0%
depth first search algorithm works right
 

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:28.300 align:start position:0%
depth first search algorithm works right
well<00:17:25.280><c> um</c><00:17:26.290><c> and</c><00:17:27.290><c> I</c><00:17:27.500><c> ended</c><00:17:27.650><c> up</c><00:17:27.740><c> getting</c><00:17:27.860><c> super</c>

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:28.310 align:start position:0%
well um and I ended up getting super
 

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
well um and I ended up getting super

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:32.570 align:start position:0%
specific in a few areas uh the the what
 

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.940 align:start position:0%
specific in a few areas uh the the what

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:37.430 align:start position:0%
question he's different um well that was
 

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.070 align:start position:0%
question he's different um well that was
that<00:17:37.730><c> was</c><00:17:37.850><c> split</c><00:17:38.120><c> up</c><00:17:38.270><c> -</c><00:17:38.510><c> because</c><00:17:38.840><c> it</c><00:17:38.960><c> was</c>

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
that was split up - because it was
 

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.350 align:start position:0%
that was split up - because it was
values<00:17:39.740><c> and</c><00:17:39.950><c> needs</c><00:17:40.160><c> right</c><00:17:40.400><c> so</c><00:17:40.610><c> value</c><00:17:41.000><c> is</c><00:17:41.330><c> a</c>

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
values and needs right so value is a
 

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
values and needs right so value is a
nice<00:17:41.540><c> way</c><00:17:41.690><c> of</c><00:17:41.720><c> saying</c><00:17:41.840><c> money</c><00:17:42.140><c> right</c><00:17:42.680><c> and</c><00:17:42.920><c> the</c>

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:43.370 align:start position:0%
nice way of saying money right and the
 

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.490 align:start position:0%
nice way of saying money right and the
needs<00:17:43.640><c> is</c><00:17:43.910><c> kind</c><00:17:44.390><c> of</c><00:17:44.450><c> separate</c><00:17:44.870><c> yeah</c><00:17:45.050><c> so</c><00:17:45.440><c> I</c>

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:45.500 align:start position:0%
needs is kind of separate yeah so I
 

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.050 align:start position:0%
needs is kind of separate yeah so I
think<00:17:45.590><c> in</c><00:17:45.860><c> terms</c><00:17:45.890><c> of</c><00:17:46.160><c> what</c><00:17:46.280><c> the</c><00:17:46.400><c> world</c><00:17:46.520><c> needs</c><00:17:46.820><c> I</c>

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:47.060 align:start position:0%
think in terms of what the world needs I
 

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.870 align:start position:0%
think in terms of what the world needs I
found<00:17:47.750><c> that</c><00:17:47.990><c> through</c><00:17:48.500><c> my</c><00:17:48.730><c> exploration</c><00:17:49.730><c> like</c>

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
found that through my exploration like
 

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.150 align:start position:0%
found that through my exploration like
it's<00:17:50.240><c> very</c><00:17:50.360><c> clear</c><00:17:50.720><c> that</c><00:17:50.750><c> okay</c><00:17:51.320><c> like</c><00:17:51.680><c> if</c><00:17:51.920><c> you</c>

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that okay like if you
 

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.490 align:start position:0%
it's very clear that okay like if you
study<00:17:52.610><c> history</c><00:17:52.790><c> and</c><00:17:53.300><c> if</c><00:17:53.690><c> you</c><00:17:53.840><c> study</c><00:17:54.170><c> science</c>

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:54.500 align:start position:0%
study history and if you study science
 

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.650 align:start position:0%
study history and if you study science

the best contribution right and in cases
 

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.820 align:start position:0%
the best contribution right and in cases
like<00:19:06.600><c> that</c><00:19:06.870><c> it</c><00:19:07.020><c> also</c><00:19:07.140><c> is</c><00:19:07.470><c> generally</c><00:19:08.100><c> harder</c><00:19:08.429><c> to</c>
