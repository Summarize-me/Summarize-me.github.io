otherwise<00:22:27.010><c> he</c><00:22:27.220><c> software</c><00:22:28.000><c> team</c><00:22:28.120><c> get</c><00:22:28.269><c> in</c>

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:28.390 align:start position:0%
otherwise he software team get in
 

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
otherwise he software team get in
because<00:22:28.720><c> there's</c><00:22:28.899><c> a</c><00:22:28.960><c> whole</c><00:22:29.110><c> software</c><00:22:29.320><c> side</c><00:22:29.710><c> to</c>
