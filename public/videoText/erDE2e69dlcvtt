00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
actually I believe the uh retrofit kit
 

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.910 align:start position:0%
actually I believe the uh retrofit kit
um<00:14:43.360><c> for</c><00:14:43.720><c> Audi's</c><00:14:44.440><c> it</c><00:14:44.639><c> actually</c><00:14:45.199><c> that</c><00:14:45.279><c> was</c><00:14:45.480><c> smart</c>

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
um for Audi's it actually that was smart
 

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.629 align:start position:0%
um for Audi's it actually that was smart
because<00:14:46.240><c> like</c><00:14:46.399><c> if</c><00:14:46.519><c> you</c><00:14:47.000><c> if</c><00:14:47.079><c> you</c><00:14:47.199><c> had</c><00:14:47.360><c> pitched</c>

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
because like if you if you had pitched
 

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:49.670 align:start position:0%

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
which is just launching payloads into

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
orbit so if you have this engine that's
 

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.950 align:start position:0%
orbit so if you have this engine that's
