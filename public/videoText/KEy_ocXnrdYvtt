entire life into this for years and then
 

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
entire life into this for years and then
you<00:09:08.480><c> know</c><00:09:08.560><c> and</c><00:09:08.640><c> then</c><00:09:08.800><c> it's</c><00:09:08.880><c> not</c><00:09:09.040><c> yours</c><00:09:09.279><c> anymore</c>

so it's at best a bittersweet feeling
 

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:14.230 align:start position:0%
so it's at best a bittersweet feeling
and<00:09:12.560><c> we</c><00:09:12.640><c> said</c><00:09:12.880><c> the</c><00:09:12.959><c> third</c><00:09:13.200><c> time</c><00:09:13.360><c> around</c>

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
and we said the third time around
 

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.750 align:start position:0%
and we said the third time around
let's<00:09:14.480><c> do</c><00:09:14.560><c> it</c><00:09:14.720><c> differently</c><00:09:15.040><c> let's</c><00:09:15.279><c> let's</c><00:09:15.519><c> have</c>

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
let's do it differently let's let's have
 

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.509 align:start position:0%
let's do it differently let's let's have
two<00:09:16.000><c> guiding</c><00:09:16.320><c> principles</c><00:09:16.720><c> let's</c><00:09:17.040><c> only</c><00:09:17.279><c> build</c>

00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
two guiding principles let's only build
 

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.949 align:start position:0%
two guiding principles let's only build
things<00:09:17.760><c> for</c><00:09:18.000><c> us</c><00:09:18.160><c> that</c><00:09:18.320><c> we're</c><00:09:18.480><c> in</c><00:09:18.560><c> love</c><00:09:18.720><c> with</c>

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.150 align:start position:0%
that we want to use
and<00:09:20.959><c> let's</c><00:09:21.200><c> build</c><00:09:21.440><c> a</c><00:09:21.519><c> company</c><00:09:21.839><c> that</c><00:09:21.920><c> we</c><00:09:22.000><c> want</c>

uh let's explicitly say there is no exit
 

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.509 align:start position:0%
uh let's explicitly say there is no exit
strategy<00:09:26.320><c> let's</c><00:09:26.640><c> make</c><00:09:26.880><c> something</c><00:09:27.279><c> that</c><00:09:27.440><c> is</c>

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%

uh

00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 

00:25:05.919 --> 00:25:08.549 align:start position:0%
uh
it<00:25:06.159><c> does</c><00:25:06.720><c> very</c><00:25:06.960><c> much</c><00:25:07.679><c> uh</c><00:25:07.919><c> but</c><00:25:08.080><c> it</c><00:25:08.240><c> also</c><00:25:08.400><c> gets</c>

00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
it does very much uh but it also gets
 

00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:09.909 align:start position:0%
it does very much uh but it also gets

get<00:25:10.080><c> easier</c>

00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
get easier
 

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:13.110 align:start position:0%
