00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 align:start position:0%
done and I was super interested in that
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
done and I was super interested in that
I<00:01:00.960><c> applied</c><00:01:01.590><c> to</c><00:01:01.739><c> YC</c><00:01:02.219><c> oh</c><00:01:02.250><c> no</c><00:01:02.399><c> like</c><00:01:02.820><c> really</c><00:01:03.570><c> that's</c>

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 align:start position:0%
I applied to YC oh no like really that's
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.899 align:start position:0%
I applied to YC oh no like really that's
like<00:01:04.080><c> really</c><00:01:04.920><c> on</c><00:01:05.070><c> a</c><00:01:05.159><c> long</c><00:01:05.369><c> shot</c><00:01:05.640><c> I</c><00:01:05.729><c> didn't</c>

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 align:start position:0%
like really on a long shot I didn't
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.700 align:start position:0%
like really on a long shot I didn't
think<00:01:06.000><c> I'd</c><00:01:06.150><c> get</c><00:01:06.270><c> in</c>

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 align:start position:0%
think I'd get in
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.510 align:start position:0%
think I'd get in
and<00:01:08.090><c> so</c><00:01:09.090><c> I</c><00:01:09.119><c> interviewed</c><00:01:09.630><c> in</c><00:01:10.409><c> Palo</c><00:01:10.890><c> Alto</c><00:01:10.950><c> and</c>

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so I interviewed in Palo Alto and
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700 align:start position:0%
and so I interviewed in Palo Alto and
although<00:01:12.180><c> the</c><00:01:12.630><c> actual</c><00:01:12.990><c> program</c><00:01:13.380><c> was</c><00:01:13.560><c> still</c>

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 align:start position:0%

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 align:start position:0%
back in Boston in Cambridge and I got in
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
back in Boston in Cambridge and I got in
so<00:01:17.040><c> I</c><00:01:17.460><c> just</c><00:01:18.030><c> dropped</c><00:01:18.450><c> out</c><00:01:18.540><c> of</c><00:01:18.600><c> graduate</c><00:01:18.810><c> school</c>

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 align:start position:0%

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
science and econ in undergrad so that
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.660 align:start position:0%
science and econ in undergrad so that
was<00:01:28.080><c> kind</c><00:01:28.290><c> of</c><00:01:28.409><c> a</c><00:01:28.530><c> small</c><00:01:28.650><c> change</c><00:01:29.509><c> and</c><00:01:30.710><c> so</c><00:01:31.710><c> yeah</c>

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 align:start position:0%
was kind of a small change and so yeah

was kind of a small change and so yeah
so<00:01:32.700><c> I</c><00:01:32.909><c> dropped</c><00:01:33.180><c> out</c><00:01:33.299><c> of</c><00:01:33.450><c> her</c><00:01:33.540><c> head</c><00:01:33.689><c> school</c><00:01:34.020><c> and</c>

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 align:start position:0%
so I dropped out of her head school and
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.870 align:start position:0%
so I dropped out of her head school and
move<00:01:35.670><c> moved</c><00:01:36.150><c> to</c><00:01:36.270><c> Cambridge</c>

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:14.610 align:start position:0%
idea um there are actually 12 so we made
 

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.300 align:start position:0%
idea um there are actually 12 so we made
12<00:09:14.880><c> different</c><00:09:15.090><c> landing</c><00:09:15.600><c> pages</c><00:09:15.740><c> well</c><00:09:16.740><c> cuz</c><00:09:16.950><c> was</c>

let's make 12 landing pages like kind of
launched<00:09:30.150><c> them</c><00:09:30.360><c> and</c><00:09:30.600><c> see</c><00:09:31.140><c> if</c><00:09:31.170><c> people</c><00:09:31.380><c> even</c>

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:31.710 align:start position:0%
launched them and see if people even
 

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.310 align:start position:0%
launched them and see if people even
give<00:09:31.950><c> us</c><00:09:32.070><c> an</c><00:09:32.190><c> email</c><00:09:32.460><c> and</c><00:09:32.790><c> b2b</c><00:09:33.390><c> products</c><00:09:33.870><c> yeah</c>

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
give us an email and b2b products yeah
 

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.910 align:start position:0%
give us an email and b2b products yeah
in<00:09:35.190><c> things</c><00:09:35.880><c> that</c><00:09:35.940><c> made</c><00:09:36.240><c> money</c><00:09:36.510><c> like</c><00:09:36.890><c> because</c><00:09:37.890><c> I</c>

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
in things that made money like because I
 

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.650 align:start position:0%
in things that made money like because I

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
think can be to see it's much harder to
 

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.140 align:start position:0%
think can be to see it's much harder to

a quick explanation of what it actually
 

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.990 align:start position:0%
a quick explanation of what it actually

so<00:14:35.120><c> parse</c><00:14:35.540><c> is</c><00:14:35.780><c> a</c><00:14:35.810><c> platform</c><00:14:36.710><c> that</c><00:14:36.770><c> helps</c><00:14:37.100><c> you</c>

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:37.370 align:start position:0%
so parse is a platform that helps you
 

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.700 align:start position:0%
so parse is a platform that helps you
make<00:14:37.520><c> mobile</c><00:14:38.210><c> applications</c><00:14:39.020><c> much</c><00:14:39.410><c> much</c>

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:39.710 align:start position:0%
make mobile applications much much
 

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.370 align:start position:0%
make mobile applications much much
faster<00:14:39.950><c> we</c><00:14:40.880><c> asked</c><00:14:41.300><c> to</c><00:14:41.450><c> make</c><00:14:41.600><c> it</c><00:14:41.660><c> roughly</c><00:14:41.930><c> 10x</c>

00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
really good one and I guess that alone
