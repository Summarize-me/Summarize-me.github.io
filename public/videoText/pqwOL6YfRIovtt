00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.950 align:start position:0%
don't make me think I'm like having to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
think about like what are they trying to
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.190 align:start position:0%
think about like what are they trying to
tell<00:01:49.119><c> me</c><00:01:49.880><c> um</c><00:01:50.280><c> there</c><00:01:50.399><c> was</c><00:01:50.520><c> a</c><00:01:50.840><c> video</c><00:01:51.840><c> we</c><00:01:51.960><c> didn't</c>

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
tell me um there was a video we didn't
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.789 align:start position:0%
tell me um there was a video we didn't
play<00:01:52.399><c> the</c><00:01:52.560><c> video</c><00:01:52.960><c> so</c><00:01:53.200><c> I</c><00:01:53.360><c> there's</c><00:01:53.560><c> probably</c>

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
play the video so I there's probably
 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.149 align:start position:0%
play the video so I there's probably
some<00:01:54.000><c> important</c><00:01:54.240><c> stuff</c><00:01:54.439><c> in</c><00:01:54.560><c> the</c><00:01:54.680><c> video</c><00:01:55.040><c> that</c>

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
some important stuff in the video that
 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.990 align:start position:0%
some important stuff in the video that
we<00:01:55.240><c> didn't</c><00:01:55.439><c> learn</c><00:01:55.719><c> about</c><00:01:56.640><c> I</c><00:01:56.759><c> think</c><00:01:57.200><c> uh</c><00:01:57.880><c> they</c>

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't learn about I think uh they
 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.469 align:start position:0%
we didn't learn about I think uh they
could<00:01:58.280><c> probably</c><00:01:58.680><c> summarize</c><00:01:59.520><c> the</c><00:01:59.880><c> ire</c><00:02:00.159><c> top</c><00:02:00.360><c> of</c>

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
could probably summarize the ire top of
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.230 align:start position:0%
could probably summarize the ire top of
fold<00:02:01.200><c> into</c><00:02:02.200><c> one</c><00:02:02.439><c> headline</c><00:02:03.240><c> one</c><00:02:03.479><c> by</c><00:02:03.719><c> line</c><00:02:04.119><c> and</c>

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
fold into one headline one by line and
 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.870 align:start position:0%
fold into one headline one by line and
one<00:02:04.439><c> called</c><00:02:04.719><c> action</c><00:02:05.320><c> I</c><00:02:05.360><c> think</c><00:02:05.479><c> that's</c><00:02:05.600><c> a</c><00:02:05.719><c> great</c>

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
one called action I think that's a great
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.350 align:start position:0%
one called action I think that's a great
point<00:02:06.119><c> cuz</c><00:02:06.399><c> actually</c><00:02:06.600><c> you</c><00:02:06.799><c> look</c><00:02:07.039><c> above</c><00:02:07.280><c> the</c>

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
point cuz actually you look above the
 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
point cuz actually you look above the
fold<00:02:07.680><c> here</c><00:02:08.119><c> yeah</c><00:02:08.319><c> and</c><00:02:08.440><c> we</c><00:02:08.599><c> have</c><00:02:08.840><c> two</c><00:02:09.160><c> equal</c>

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
fold here yeah and we have two equal
 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.270 align:start position:0%
fold here yeah and we have two equal
weight<00:02:10.000><c> columns</c><00:02:11.000><c> and</c><00:02:11.280><c> I</c><00:02:11.360><c> think</c><00:02:11.560><c> what</c><00:02:11.879><c> that</c><00:02:12.879><c> uh</c>

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
weight columns and I think what that uh
 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.910 align:start position:0%
weight columns and I think what that uh
tells<00:02:14.000><c> the</c><00:02:14.239><c> the</c><00:02:14.360><c> user</c><00:02:14.800><c> here</c><00:02:15.080><c> is</c><00:02:15.239><c> that</c><00:02:15.440><c> both</c><00:02:15.640><c> are</c>

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
tells the the user here is that both are
 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.630 align:start position:0%
tells the the user here is that both are
equally<00:02:16.360><c> important</c><00:02:17.360><c> and</c><00:02:17.560><c> that</c><00:02:18.080><c> you</c><00:02:18.319><c> should</c>

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
equally important and that you should
 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.710 align:start position:0%
equally important and that you should
wait<00:02:19.200><c> both</c><00:02:19.519><c> the</c><00:02:19.640><c> same</c><00:02:20.040><c> look</c><00:02:20.160><c> at</c><00:02:20.280><c> this</c><00:02:20.519><c> if</c><00:02:20.599><c> you</c>

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
wait both the same look at this if you
 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.869 align:start position:0%
wait both the same look at this if you
scroll<00:02:21.160><c> down</c><00:02:22.160><c> like</c><00:02:22.400><c> that</c><00:02:22.519><c> should</c><00:02:22.680><c> be</c><00:02:22.800><c> the</c>

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 align:start position:0%
scroll down like that should be the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
different call to actions here too which
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.270 align:start position:0%
different call to actions here too which
I<00:02:39.760><c> think</c><00:02:40.239><c> sometimes</c><00:02:40.440><c> when</c><00:02:40.599><c> people</c><00:02:40.800><c> are</c><00:02:41.159><c> uh</c>

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
I think sometimes when people are uh
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.869 align:start position:0%
I think sometimes when people are uh
designing<00:02:41.640><c> websites</c><00:02:42.080><c> they're</c><00:02:42.280><c> like</c><00:02:42.720><c> let's</c>

designing websites they're like let's
 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.710 align:start position:0%
designing websites they're like let's
put<00:02:43.000><c> a</c><00:02:43.200><c> bunch</c><00:02:43.519><c> on</c><00:02:43.760><c> here</c><00:02:44.040><c> because</c><00:02:44.360><c> certainly</c>

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
put a bunch on here because certainly
 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.790 align:start position:0%
put a bunch on here because certainly
we'll<00:02:44.840><c> get</c><00:02:44.959><c> the</c><00:02:45.040><c> user</c><00:02:45.360><c> with</c><00:02:45.560><c> one</c><00:02:45.720><c> of</c><00:02:45.920><c> them</c><00:02:46.640><c> but</c>

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.390 align:start position:0%
had a really nice clean headline and
then<00:05:26.199><c> the</c><00:05:27.120><c> uh</c><00:05:27.560><c> illustration</c><00:05:28.560><c> had</c><00:05:28.800><c> motion</c><00:05:29.240><c> to</c>

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
then the uh illustration had motion to
 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.029 align:start position:0%
then the uh illustration had motion to
kind<00:05:29.520><c> of</c><00:05:29.720><c> show</c><00:05:29.960><c> me</c><00:05:30.160><c> the</c><00:05:30.400><c> product</c><00:05:30.720><c> in</c><00:05:30.840><c> an</c>

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
kind of show me the product in an
 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.110 align:start position:0%
kind of show me the product in an

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
intuitive way then it's kind of like a
 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.790 align:start position:0%
intuitive way then it's kind of like a
no-brainer<00:05:33.680><c> and</c><00:05:33.800><c> you</c><00:05:33.960><c> kind</c><00:05:34.039><c> of</c><00:05:34.400><c> right</c><00:05:34.560><c> away</c>

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
no-brainer and you kind of right away
 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.070 align:start position:0%
no-brainer and you kind of right away
know<00:05:34.960><c> what</c><00:05:35.080><c> it</c><00:05:35.160><c> is</c><00:05:35.440><c> and</c><00:05:35.520><c> I</c><00:05:35.600><c> think</c><00:05:35.720><c> the</c><00:05:35.800><c> key</c><00:05:35.960><c> of</c>

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
know what it is and I think the key of
 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.790 align:start position:0%
know what it is and I think the key of
what<00:05:36.199><c> you</c><00:05:36.319><c> said</c><00:05:36.560><c> is</c><00:05:36.840><c> like</c><00:05:37.800><c> movement</c><00:05:38.360><c> draws</c>

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
what you said is like movement draws
 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.510 align:start position:0%
what you said is like movement draws
your<00:05:39.039><c> eye</c><00:05:39.600><c> totally</c><00:05:39.919><c> and</c><00:05:40.000><c> so</c><00:05:40.120><c> if</c><00:05:40.240><c> there's</c>

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
your eye totally and so if there's
 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.270 align:start position:0%
your eye totally and so if there's
things<00:05:40.800><c> that</c><00:05:40.919><c> you</c><00:05:41.240><c> really</c><00:05:41.440><c> want</c><00:05:41.560><c> to</c><00:05:41.759><c> make</c><00:05:41.919><c> sure</c>

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
right out of the gate put some motion
 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.990 align:start position:0%
right out of the gate put some motion
around<00:05:47.319><c> it</c><00:05:47.520><c> have</c><00:05:47.639><c> it</c><00:05:47.800><c> animate</c><00:05:48.280><c> in</c><00:05:48.680><c> do</c>

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
something and that will draw the
 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.629 align:start position:0%
something and that will draw the

tools<00:06:29.919><c> okay</c><00:06:30.120><c> infrastructure</c><00:06:30.680><c> stack</c><00:06:31.160><c> I</c><00:06:31.319><c> think</c>

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
tools okay infrastructure stack I think
 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.790 align:start position:0%
tools okay infrastructure stack I think
and<00:06:32.759><c> it's</c><00:06:32.880><c> going</c><00:06:33.000><c> to</c><00:06:33.120><c> save</c><00:06:33.479><c> money</c><00:06:34.479><c> but</c><00:06:34.800><c> yeah</c>

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
and it's going to save money but yeah
 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.390 align:start position:0%
and it's going to save money but yeah
there<00:06:35.880><c> was</c><00:06:36.039><c> a</c><00:06:36.160><c> lot</c>

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
there was a lot
 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.550 align:start position:0%
there was a lot
so<00:06:38.400><c> I</c><00:06:38.479><c> think</c><00:06:38.639><c> the</c><00:06:38.759><c> last</c><00:06:38.880><c> one</c><00:06:39.039><c> we</c><00:06:39.199><c> talked</c><00:06:39.400><c> about</c>

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
so I think the last one we talked about
 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.189 align:start position:0%
so I think the last one we talked about
motion<00:06:40.160><c> this</c><00:06:40.240><c> one</c><00:06:40.440><c> had</c><00:06:40.599><c> motion</c><00:06:40.960><c> but</c><00:06:41.080><c> the</c>

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
motion distracted me from the main
 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.909 align:start position:0%
motion distracted me from the main
message<00:06:44.199><c> yes</c><00:06:45.199><c> um</c><00:06:45.840><c> so</c><00:06:46.160><c> I</c><00:06:46.240><c> didn't</c><00:06:46.639><c> really</c><00:06:47.639><c> catch</c>

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
more I think there was like a preloader
 

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.310 align:start position:0%
more I think there was like a preloader
too<00:10:46.519><c> and</c><00:10:46.639><c> it</c><00:10:46.800><c> waited</c><00:10:47.040><c> for</c><00:10:47.200><c> the</c><00:10:47.320><c> pre-loader</c><00:10:48.120><c> to</c>

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
too and it waited for the pre-loader to
 

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.509 align:start position:0%
too and it waited for the pre-loader to
load<00:10:48.720><c> that</c><00:10:48.920><c> wavy</c><00:10:49.399><c> thing</c><00:10:49.800><c> and</c><00:10:49.880><c> so</c><00:10:50.040><c> the</c><00:10:50.120><c> wavy</c>

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
load that wavy thing and so the wavy
 

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.350 align:start position:0%
load that wavy thing and so the wavy
thing<00:10:50.760><c> wasn't</c><00:10:51.040><c> worth</c><00:10:51.360><c> waiting</c><00:10:51.920><c> for</c><00:10:52.079><c> it</c><00:10:52.200><c> to</c>

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
thing wasn't worth waiting for it to
 

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
thing wasn't worth waiting for it to
load<00:10:52.839><c> yes</c><00:10:53.839><c> um</c><00:10:54.320><c> so</c><00:10:54.519><c> yeah</c><00:10:54.680><c> definitely</c><00:10:55.240><c> uh</c><00:10:55.639><c> uh</c>

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
load yes um so yeah definitely uh uh
 

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.069 align:start position:0%
load yes um so yeah definitely uh uh
there<00:10:55.880><c> could</c><00:10:56.000><c> be</c><00:10:56.079><c> a</c><00:10:56.120><c> better</c><00:10:56.320><c> use</c><00:10:56.440><c> of</c><00:10:56.639><c> space</c><00:10:56.880><c> up</c>

00:10:57.069 --> 00:10:57.079 align:start position:0%
there could be a better use of space up
 

00:10:57.079 --> 00:10:58.509 align:start position:0%
there could be a better use of space up
there<00:10:57.440><c> and</c><00:10:57.560><c> then</c><00:10:57.639><c> the</c><00:10:57.800><c> textt</c><00:10:58.040><c> was</c><00:10:58.279><c> really</c>

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
or that helps to better illustrate a
 

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.790 align:start position:0%
or that helps to better illustrate a

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%

00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
and it seems like these don't really do
 

00:12:22.079 --> 00:12:25.069 align:start position:0%
and it seems like these don't really do
either<00:12:22.360><c> of</c><00:12:22.600><c> those</c><00:12:23.040><c> uh</c><00:12:23.199><c> use</c><00:12:23.519><c> cases</c><00:12:24.199><c> yeah</c><00:12:24.519><c> cool</c>

00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
either of those uh use cases yeah cool

00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
super clear to me but um you know I
 

00:13:57.959 --> 00:13:59.829 align:start position:0%
super clear to me but um you know I

00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
think the other thing is I think the sub
 

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.189 align:start position:0%
think the other thing is I think the sub
headline<00:14:00.240><c> and</c><00:14:00.320><c> the</c><00:14:00.440><c> text</c><00:14:00.639><c> on</c><00:14:00.759><c> the</c><00:14:00.839><c> buttons</c>

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
headline and the text on the buttons
 

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:02.230 align:start position:0%
headline and the text on the buttons
could<00:14:01.360><c> probably</c><00:14:01.560><c> be</c>

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
could probably be
 

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.629 align:start position:0%
could probably be
larger<00:14:03.240><c> um</c><00:14:03.920><c> because</c><00:14:04.040><c> they</c><00:14:04.160><c> have</c><00:14:04.279><c> the</c><00:14:04.440><c> space</c>

00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
larger um because they have the space
 

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:06.670 align:start position:0%
larger um because they have the space
and<00:14:04.759><c> there's</c><00:14:04.920><c> not</c><00:14:05.040><c> a</c><00:14:05.120><c> lot</c><00:14:05.240><c> of</c><00:14:05.360><c> words</c><00:14:05.800><c> and</c>

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
and there's not a lot of words and
 

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.230 align:start position:0%
and there's not a lot of words and
wouldn't<00:14:06.920><c> have</c><00:14:07.079><c> to</c><00:14:07.160><c> strain</c><00:14:07.680><c> as</c><00:14:07.800><c> much</c><00:14:07.959><c> through</c>

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to strain as much through
 

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.069 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to strain as much through
that<00:14:08.360><c> I</c><00:14:08.440><c> don't</c><00:14:08.519><c> know</c><00:14:08.680><c> maybe</c><00:14:08.839><c> we're</c><00:14:08.959><c> just</c>

00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
that I don't know maybe we're just
 

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:11.310 align:start position:0%

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just hard to digest
 

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.150 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just hard to digest
diseas<00:16:59.279><c> yeah</c><00:16:59.440><c> and</c><00:16:59.519><c> then</c><00:16:59.600><c> we</c><00:16:59.720><c> have</c><00:16:59.880><c> little</c>

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
diseas yeah and then we have little
 

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.949 align:start position:0%
diseas yeah and then we have little
icons<00:17:00.639><c> at</c><00:17:00.720><c> the</c><00:17:00.839><c> bottom</c><00:17:01.240><c> so</c><00:17:01.480><c> okay</c><00:17:01.600><c> I</c><00:17:01.680><c> see</c><00:17:01.839><c> that's</c>

00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:01.959 align:start position:0%
icons at the bottom so okay I see that's
 

00:17:01.959 --> 00:17:03.550 align:start position:0%
icons at the bottom so okay I see that's
a<00:17:02.079><c> notion</c><00:17:02.480><c> icon</c><00:17:02.839><c> but</c><00:17:02.959><c> that</c><00:17:03.040><c> was</c><00:17:03.160><c> kind</c><00:17:03.279><c> of</c><00:17:03.399><c> hard</c>

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
a notion icon but that was kind of hard
 

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.630 align:start position:0%
a notion icon but that was kind of hard
to<00:17:03.680><c> tell</c><00:17:04.640><c> um</c><00:17:04.799><c> so</c><00:17:04.959><c> I</c><00:17:05.039><c> assume</c><00:17:05.319><c> that's</c><00:17:05.480><c> like</c>

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
to tell um so I assume that's like
 

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.510 align:start position:0%
to tell um so I assume that's like
different<00:17:05.959><c> formats</c><00:17:06.400><c> that</c><00:17:06.559><c> they</c><00:17:06.679><c> support</c><00:17:07.160><c> but</c>

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
different formats that they support but
 

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.949 align:start position:0%
different formats that they support but
but<00:17:07.640><c> what</c><00:17:07.720><c> does</c><00:17:07.839><c> it</c><00:17:08.039><c> represent</c><00:17:08.559><c> right</c><00:17:08.760><c> like</c>

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
but what does it represent right like
 

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:10.429 align:start position:0%
but what does it represent right like
what<00:17:09.039><c> does</c><00:17:09.160><c> that</c><00:17:09.319><c> actually</c><00:17:09.520><c> mean</c><00:17:10.039><c> yeah</c><00:17:10.199><c> and</c><00:17:10.280><c> if</c>

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
what does that actually mean yeah and if
 

00:17:10.439 --> 00:17:11.630 align:start position:0%
what does that actually mean yeah and if
that's<00:17:10.559><c> the</c><00:17:10.679><c> point</c><00:17:10.880><c> you</c><00:17:10.959><c> want</c><00:17:11.039><c> to</c><00:17:11.199><c> make</c><00:17:11.439><c> like</c>
