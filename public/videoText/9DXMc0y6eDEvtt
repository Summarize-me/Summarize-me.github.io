exactly I mean if you're giving people
 

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
exactly I mean if you're giving people
an<00:27:57.650><c> opportunity</c><00:27:57.770><c> to</c><00:27:58.580><c> like</c><00:27:59.000><c> cheap</c><00:27:59.270><c> the</c><00:27:59.420><c> system</c>

they<00:28:00.170><c> likely</c><00:28:00.650><c> will</c><00:28:00.890><c> achieve</c><00:28:01.010><c> this</c><00:28:01.400><c> okay</c><00:28:02.090><c> so</c>

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:02.420 align:start position:0%
they likely will achieve this okay so
 

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
they likely will achieve this okay so
you<00:28:02.510><c> can</c><00:28:02.660><c> make</c><00:28:02.809><c> it</c><00:28:02.960><c> like</c><00:28:03.110><c> a</c><00:28:03.140><c> little</c><00:28:03.440><c> bit</c>

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:03.650 align:start position:0%
you can make it like a little bit
 

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:06.190 align:start position:0%
you can make it like a little bit
