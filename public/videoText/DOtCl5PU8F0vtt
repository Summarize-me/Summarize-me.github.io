this company or here's the things I need
to<00:06:03.600><c> prove</c><00:06:03.960><c> the</c><00:06:04.590><c> show</c><00:06:04.740><c> that</c><00:06:04.919><c> this</c><00:06:05.010><c> company</c>

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 align:start position:0%
to prove the show that this company
 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.469 align:start position:0%
to prove the show that this company
could<00:06:05.700><c> do</c><00:06:05.850><c> well</c><00:06:06.110><c> so</c><00:06:07.110><c> the</c><00:06:07.800><c> first</c><00:06:08.130><c> is</c><00:06:08.550><c> the</c>

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
could do well so the first is the
 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.060 align:start position:0%
could do well so the first is the
problem<00:06:09.900><c> so</c><00:06:10.169><c> startup</c><00:06:10.440><c> idea</c><00:06:10.680><c> is</c><00:06:10.740><c> composed</c><00:06:10.979><c> of</c>

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 align:start position:0%
problem so startup idea is composed of
 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
problem so startup idea is composed of
three<00:06:11.280><c> parts</c><00:06:11.580><c> the</c><00:06:11.880><c> first</c><00:06:11.910><c> part</c><00:06:12.180><c> is</c><00:06:12.419><c> a</c><00:06:12.479><c> problem</c>

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 align:start position:0%
three parts the first part is a problem
 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.330 align:start position:0%
three parts the first part is a problem
and<00:06:13.050><c> it's</c><00:06:13.200><c> basically</c><00:06:13.560><c> the</c><00:06:13.770><c> initial</c>

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
and it's basically the initial
 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.550 align:start position:0%
and it's basically the initial
conditions<00:06:14.940><c> you</c><00:06:15.780><c> have</c><00:06:15.810><c> to</c><00:06:15.990><c> explain</c><00:06:16.229><c> to</c><00:06:16.440><c> me</c>

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
conditions you have to explain to me
 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.740 align:start position:0%
conditions you have to explain to me
like<00:06:16.800><c> what</c><00:06:17.160><c> is</c><00:06:17.430><c> the</c><00:06:17.820><c> setting</c><00:06:18.240><c> for</c><00:06:18.389><c> this</c>

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 align:start position:0%
like what is the setting for this
 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
like what is the setting for this
company<00:06:19.430><c> that</c><00:06:20.430><c> allows</c><00:06:20.669><c> it</c><00:06:20.970><c> to</c><00:06:21.000><c> be</c><00:06:21.360><c> able</c><00:06:21.479><c> to</c>

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 align:start position:0%
company that allows it to be able to
 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.159 align:start position:0%
company that allows it to be able to
grow<00:06:21.720><c> quickly</c><00:06:22.430><c> the</c><00:06:23.430><c> second</c><00:06:23.729><c> is</c><00:06:23.930><c> the</c><00:06:24.930><c> solution</c>

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:25.169 align:start position:0%
grow quickly the second is the solution
 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.930 align:start position:0%
grow quickly the second is the solution
so<00:06:25.650><c> this</c><00:06:25.889><c> is</c><00:06:26.070><c> basically</c><00:06:26.430><c> what</c><00:06:26.700><c> is</c><00:06:26.789><c> the</c>

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
so this is basically what is the
 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.290 align:start position:0%
so this is basically what is the
experiment<00:06:27.570><c> that</c><00:06:27.600><c> you're</c><00:06:27.870><c> basically</c><00:06:28.260><c> running</c>

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 align:start position:0%
experiment that you're basically running
 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.670 align:start position:0%
experiment that you're basically running
within<00:06:30.300><c> those</c><00:06:30.419><c> conditions</c><00:06:30.990><c> for</c><00:06:31.350><c> it</c><00:06:31.440><c> to</c><00:06:31.530><c> grow</c>

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
within those conditions for it to grow
 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.890 align:start position:0%
within those conditions for it to grow
really<00:06:31.889><c> quickly</c><00:06:31.979><c> and</c><00:06:32.490><c> the</c><00:06:33.150><c> third</c><00:06:33.419><c> is</c><00:06:33.600><c> what's</c>

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
really quickly and the third is what's
 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.149 align:start position:0%
really quickly and the third is what's
your<00:06:33.990><c> insight</c><00:06:34.289><c> so</c><00:06:34.440><c> what's</c><00:06:34.650><c> your</c><00:06:34.800><c> explanation</c>

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 align:start position:0%

you've thought through this problem all

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:02.529 align:start position:0%
oftentimes for me it's like oh then

oftentimes for me it's like oh then
building<00:19:03.129><c> it</c><00:19:03.279><c> can</c><00:19:03.759><c> they</c><00:19:03.970><c> even</c><00:19:04.299><c> built</c><00:19:04.480><c> it</c>

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
building it can they even built it
 

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
building it can they even built it
that's<00:19:05.440><c> a</c><00:19:05.529><c> threshold</c><00:19:05.710><c> belief</c><00:19:06.100><c> if</c><00:19:06.309><c> they</c><00:19:06.639><c> can't</c>

00:19:06.899 --> 00:19:06.909 align:start position:0%
that's a threshold belief if they can't
 

00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's a threshold belief if they can't
even<00:19:07.240><c> build</c><00:19:07.389><c> it</c><00:19:07.600><c> none</c><00:19:07.869><c> of</c><00:19:07.990><c> it</c><00:19:08.080><c> even</c><00:19:08.139><c> matters</c>

00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:08.649 align:start position:0%
even build it none of it even matters
 

00:19:08.649 --> 00:19:11.070 align:start position:0%
even build it none of it even matters

and so to me that question is not the

programmer<00:23:34.760><c> to</c><00:23:35.120><c> be</c><00:23:35.330><c> able</c><00:23:35.420><c> to</c><00:23:35.570><c> do</c><00:23:35.780><c> it</c><00:23:35.929><c> and</c><00:23:36.250><c> so</c>

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:37.250 align:start position:0%
programmer to be able to do it and so
 

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.830 align:start position:0%
programmer to be able to do it and so
the<00:23:37.370><c> solution</c><00:23:37.730><c> was</c><00:23:37.850><c> to</c><00:23:37.880><c> build</c><00:23:38.030><c> something</c><00:23:38.240><c> that</c>

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
the solution was to build something that
 

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.630 align:start position:0%
the solution was to build something that
what<00:23:39.350><c> they</c><00:23:39.500><c> see</c><00:23:39.559><c> is</c><00:23:39.800><c> what</c><00:23:39.830><c> they</c><00:23:40.070><c> got</c><00:23:40.220><c> like</c>

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
what they see is what they got like
 

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.210 align:start position:0%
what they see is what they got like
basically<00:23:41.000><c> a</c><00:23:41.150><c> drag-and-drop</c><00:23:41.830><c> visual</c><00:23:42.830><c> editor</c>

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:43.220 align:start position:0%
basically a drag-and-drop visual editor
 

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.730 align:start position:0%
basically a drag-and-drop visual editor
and<00:23:43.390><c> that</c><00:23:44.390><c> any</c><00:23:44.630><c> non-technical</c><00:23:45.230><c> person</c><00:23:45.410><c> sort</c>

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:45.740 align:start position:0%
and that any non-technical person sort
 

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
and that any non-technical person sort
of<00:23:45.830><c> create</c><00:23:46.190><c> and</c><00:23:46.400><c> then</c><00:23:46.910><c> if</c><00:23:47.030><c> we</c><00:23:47.150><c> did</c><00:23:47.390><c> that</c><00:23:47.630><c> we</c>

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:47.929 align:start position:0%
of create and then if we did that we
 

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:49.570 align:start position:0%
of create and then if we did that we
would<00:23:48.110><c> solve</c><00:23:48.350><c> that</c><00:23:48.530><c> sort</c><00:23:48.890><c> of</c><00:23:48.920><c> specific</c>

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:49.580 align:start position:0%
would solve that sort of specific
 

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
would solve that sort of specific
problem<00:23:50.230><c> so</c><00:23:51.230><c> very</c><00:23:51.500><c> quickly</c><00:23:51.740><c> the</c><00:23:52.250><c> market</c><00:23:52.610><c> it's</c>

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:53.450 align:start position:0%
