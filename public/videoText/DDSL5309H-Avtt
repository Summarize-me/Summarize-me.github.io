we go back and forth and sort of like
what<00:02:34.680><c> the</c><00:02:34.830><c> model</c><00:02:35.130><c> is</c><00:02:35.250><c> for</c><00:02:35.430><c> that</c><00:02:35.520><c> and</c><00:02:35.820><c> can</c><00:02:36.090><c> they</c>

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
what the model is for that and can they
 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.250 align:start position:0%
what the model is for that and can they
you<00:02:36.750><c> know</c><00:02:36.780><c> can</c><00:02:37.110><c> they</c><00:02:37.200><c> be</c><00:02:37.260><c> profitable</c><00:02:38.070><c> or</c><00:02:38.760><c> not</c>

you know can they be profitable or not
 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.870 align:start position:0%

paying<00:20:35.650><c> more</c><00:20:35.830><c> attention</c><00:20:35.860><c> to</c><00:20:36.220><c> it</c><00:20:36.310><c> like</c><00:20:36.520><c> the</c>

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:36.610 align:start position:0%
paying more attention to it like the
 

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.530 align:start position:0%
paying more attention to it like the
platforms<00:20:37.090><c> are</c><00:20:37.210><c> paying</c><00:20:37.360><c> a</c><00:20:37.420><c> lot</c><00:20:37.510><c> more</c>

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:37.540 align:start position:0%
platforms are paying a lot more
 

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
platforms are paying a lot more
attention<00:20:37.660><c> to</c><00:20:37.960><c> it</c><00:20:38.110><c> now</c><00:20:38.260><c> so</c><00:20:38.800><c> like</c><00:20:39.010><c> Spotify</c><00:20:39.370><c> tune</c>

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:39.670 align:start position:0%
attention to it now so like Spotify tune
 

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.370 align:start position:0%
attention to it now so like Spotify tune
in<00:20:39.850><c> and</c><00:20:40.030><c> of</c><00:20:40.330><c> course</c><00:20:40.510><c> Apple</c><00:20:40.840><c> Apple</c><00:20:41.110><c> was</c><00:20:41.230><c> the</c>

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:41.380 align:start position:0%
in and of course Apple Apple was the
 

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.230 align:start position:0%
in and of course Apple Apple was the
dominant<00:20:41.740><c> just</c><00:20:41.980><c> sort</c><00:20:42.130><c> of</c><00:20:42.160><c> like</c><00:20:42.460><c> by</c><00:20:42.910><c> by</c>

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
dominant just sort of like by by
 

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.710 align:start position:0%
dominant just sort of like by by
accident<00:20:43.630><c> they</c><00:20:43.690><c> created</c><00:20:43.990><c> the</c><00:20:44.050><c> category</c><00:20:45.720><c> and</c>

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
accident they created the category and
 

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
accident they created the category and
it<00:20:47.350><c> sort</c><00:20:47.530><c> of</c><00:20:47.590><c> created</c><00:20:47.920><c> this</c><00:20:47.980><c> whole</c><00:20:48.100><c> ecosystem</c>

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:48.610 align:start position:0%
it sort of created this whole ecosystem
 

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
it sort of created this whole ecosystem
but<00:20:49.540><c> like</c><00:20:49.750><c> the</c><00:20:50.290><c> ecosystem</c><00:20:50.740><c> even</c><00:20:50.860><c> that</c><00:20:51.040><c> was</c>

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:51.130 align:start position:0%
but like the ecosystem even that was
 

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
but like the ecosystem even that was
getting<00:20:51.370><c> larger</c><00:20:51.730><c> by</c><00:20:52.090><c> our</c><00:20:52.300><c> standards</c><00:20:52.750><c> by</c><00:20:52.990><c> Apple</c>

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:53.290 align:start position:0%
getting larger by our standards by Apple
 

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
getting larger by our standards by Apple
standards<00:20:53.590><c> was</c><00:20:53.740><c> still</c><00:20:53.920><c> like</c><00:20:54.100><c> a</c><00:20:54.130><c> tiny</c><00:20:54.400><c> you</c><00:20:54.700><c> know</c>

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:54.790 align:start position:0%
standards was still like a tiny you know
 

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.990 align:start position:0%
standards was still like a tiny you know
sort<00:20:54.970><c> of</c><00:20:55.000><c> rounding</c><00:20:55.330><c> error</c><00:20:56.490><c> and</c><00:20:57.490><c> now</c><00:20:57.790><c> it's</c>

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
sort of rounding error and now it's
 

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
sort of rounding error and now it's
gotten<00:20:58.180><c> beyond</c><00:20:58.450><c> rounding</c><00:20:58.780><c> error</c><00:20:58.930><c> status</c><00:20:59.170><c> and</c>

00:20:59.400 --> 00:20:59.410 align:start position:0%
gotten beyond rounding error status and
 

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
gotten beyond rounding error status and
so<00:20:59.500><c> they're</c><00:20:59.650><c> starting</c><00:20:59.770><c> to</c><00:20:59.920><c> pay</c><00:21:00.010><c> attention</c><00:21:00.070><c> as</c>

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:00.430 align:start position:0%
so they're starting to pay attention as
 

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.660 align:start position:0%
so they're starting to pay attention as
well<00:21:01.020><c> which</c><00:21:02.020><c> is</c><00:21:02.200><c> all</c><00:21:02.440><c> you</c><00:21:03.160><c> know</c><00:21:03.250><c> so</c><00:21:03.400><c> like</c><00:21:03.550><c> I</c>

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:03.670 align:start position:0%
well which is all you know so like I
 

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
well which is all you know so like I
think<00:21:03.730><c> now</c><00:21:04.180><c> there</c><00:21:04.510><c> are</c><00:21:04.600><c> the</c><00:21:04.780><c> platforms</c><00:21:04.990><c> are</c>

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:05.410 align:start position:0%
think now there are the platforms are
 

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
think now there are the platforms are
like<00:21:05.590><c> starting</c><00:21:05.980><c> to</c><00:21:06.130><c> starting</c><00:21:06.880><c> to</c><00:21:07.000><c> sort</c><00:21:07.180><c> of</c>

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:07.270 align:start position:0%
like starting to starting to sort of
 

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.090 align:start position:0%
like starting to starting to sort of
like<00:21:07.420><c> compete</c><00:21:08.260><c> a</c><00:21:08.290><c> little</c><00:21:08.440><c> bit</c><00:21:08.680><c> and</c><00:21:08.980><c> you</c><00:21:09.070><c> see</c>

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.100 align:start position:0%
like compete a little bit and you see
 

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.130 align:start position:0%
like compete a little bit and you see
you<00:21:09.670><c> know</c><00:21:09.760><c> sort</c><00:21:10.000><c> of</c><00:21:10.030><c> you</c><00:21:10.180><c> see</c><00:21:10.360><c> like</c><00:21:10.720><c> sort</c><00:21:11.110><c> of</c>

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:11.140 align:start position:0%
you know sort of you see like sort of
 

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.610 align:start position:0%
you know sort of you see like sort of
like<00:21:12.090><c> deals</c><00:21:13.090><c> around</c><00:21:13.330><c> content</c><00:21:13.930><c> happening</c><00:21:14.440><c> and</c>

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:14.620 align:start position:0%
like deals around content happening and
 

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.530 align:start position:0%
like deals around content happening and
that<00:21:14.710><c> sort</c><00:21:14.890><c> of</c><00:21:14.920><c> thing</c><00:21:15.100><c> so</c><00:21:15.130><c> so</c><00:21:15.820><c> that's</c><00:21:15.940><c> that's</c>

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:16.540 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so so that's that's
 

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so so that's that's
that's<00:21:16.840><c> also</c><00:21:17.110><c> really</c><00:21:17.320><c> exciting</c><00:21:17.680><c> because</c>

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.070 align:start position:0%
that's also really exciting because
 

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's also really exciting because
distribution<00:21:18.760><c> is</c><00:21:18.880><c> so</c><00:21:19.270><c> difficult</c><00:21:19.630><c> still</c><00:21:20.290><c> I</c>

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:20.470 align:start position:0%
distribution is so difficult still I
 

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
distribution is so difficult still I
mean<00:21:20.650><c> it's</c><00:21:20.830><c> been</c><00:21:21.040><c> hard</c><00:21:21.310><c> but</c><00:21:21.460><c> now</c><00:21:21.610><c> it's</c><00:21:21.820><c> like</c>

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:22.150 align:start position:0%
mean it's been hard but now it's like
 

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
mean it's been hard but now it's like
both<00:21:22.450><c> hard</c><00:21:23.080><c> to</c><00:21:23.350><c> discover</c><00:21:23.650><c> and</c><00:21:24.070><c> competitive</c>

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:24.970 align:start position:0%
both hard to discover and competitive
 

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.110 align:start position:0%
both hard to discover and competitive
yeah<00:21:25.570><c> and</c><00:21:25.750><c> so</c><00:21:25.900><c> what</c><00:21:26.680><c> do</c><00:21:26.740><c> you</c><00:21:26.860><c> guys</c><00:21:27.070><c> do</c><00:21:27.460><c> when</c><00:21:28.030><c> you</c>

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and so what do you guys do when you
 

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.330 align:start position:0%
yeah and so what do you guys do when you
have<00:21:28.270><c> a</c><00:21:28.300><c> brand</c><00:21:28.630><c> new</c><00:21:28.720><c> show</c><00:21:29.050><c> and</c><00:21:29.380><c> you're</c><00:21:29.920><c> like</c><00:21:30.100><c> we</c>

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:30.340 align:start position:0%
have a brand new show and you're like we
 

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.370 align:start position:0%
have a brand new show and you're like we
need<00:21:30.520><c> to</c><00:21:30.610><c> start</c><00:21:30.910><c> this</c><00:21:31.120><c> out</c><00:21:31.300><c> with</c><00:21:31.360><c> I</c><00:21:31.990><c> don't</c><00:21:32.290><c> know</c>

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:32.380 align:start position:0%
need to start this out with I don't know
 

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
need to start this out with I don't know
like<00:21:32.740><c> whatever</c><00:21:32.980><c> your</c><00:21:33.310><c> benchmark</c><00:21:33.760><c> is</c><00:21:33.910><c> for</c><00:21:34.120><c> like</c>

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:34.210 align:start position:0%
like whatever your benchmark is for like
 

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
like whatever your benchmark is for like
a<00:21:34.240><c> good</c><00:21:34.480><c> amount</c><00:21:34.660><c> of</c><00:21:34.750><c> listeners</c><00:21:35.140><c> in</c><00:21:35.260><c> the</c>

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:35.290 align:start position:0%
a good amount of listeners in the
 

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.770 align:start position:0%
a good amount of listeners in the
beginning<00:21:35.650><c> how</c><00:21:36.280><c> do</c><00:21:36.340><c> you</c><00:21:36.430><c> make</c><00:21:36.550><c> that</c><00:21:36.640><c> happen</c>

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
beginning how do you make that happen
 

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.970 align:start position:0%
beginning how do you make that happen
yeah<00:21:37.780><c> I</c><00:21:37.810><c> mean</c><00:21:38.020><c> that's</c><00:21:38.230><c> changed</c><00:21:38.620><c> a</c><00:21:38.680><c> little</c><00:21:38.800><c> bit</c>

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:38.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's changed a little bit
 

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.710 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's changed a little bit
like<00:21:39.190><c> we</c><00:21:39.370><c> it</c><00:21:39.880><c> used</c><00:21:40.120><c> to</c><00:21:40.330><c> be</c><00:21:42.060><c> that</c><00:21:43.060><c> we</c><00:21:43.240><c> didn't</c>

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
like we it used to be that we didn't
 

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
like we it used to be that we didn't
have<00:21:43.810><c> to</c><00:21:43.960><c> do</c><00:21:44.260><c> as</c><00:21:44.650><c> much</c><00:21:45.070><c> you</c><00:21:45.670><c> know</c><00:21:45.790><c> I</c><00:21:45.820><c> don't</c><00:21:46.150><c> the</c>

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:46.330 align:start position:0%
have to do as much you know I don't the
 

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
have to do as much you know I don't the
landscape<00:21:46.660><c> has</c><00:21:46.780><c> gotten</c><00:21:47.020><c> more</c><00:21:47.140><c> crowded</c><00:21:47.380><c> I</c>

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:47.650 align:start position:0%
landscape has gotten more crowded I
 

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
landscape has gotten more crowded I
think<00:21:47.860><c> also</c><00:21:48.150><c> like</c><00:21:49.150><c> politics</c><00:21:49.960><c> has</c><00:21:50.110><c> become</c><00:21:50.380><c> a</c>

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:50.410 align:start position:0%
think also like politics has become a
 

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
think also like politics has become a
much<00:21:51.030><c> bigger</c><00:21:52.030><c> storyline</c><00:21:52.630><c> and</c><00:21:52.900><c> you've</c><00:21:53.020><c> got</c>

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.170 align:start position:0%
much bigger storyline and you've got
 

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
much bigger storyline and you've got
shows<00:21:53.410><c> coming</c><00:21:53.710><c> out</c><00:21:53.830><c> like</c><00:21:53.980><c> pots</c><00:21:54.340><c> of</c><00:21:54.490><c> American</c>

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:54.850 align:start position:0%
shows coming out like pots of American

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:13.340 align:start position:0%
seems less and less likely like just
 

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.369 align:start position:0%
seems less and less likely like just
because<00:30:13.639><c> you</c><00:30:14.419><c> know</c><00:30:14.539><c> the</c><00:30:14.629><c> Spotify</c><00:30:14.929><c> is</c><00:30:15.109><c> and</c><00:30:15.320><c> the</c>

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.230 align:start position:0%
definitely paying attention and so it
 

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%

like so it sounds like you're just
 

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
like so it sounds like you're just
saying<00:37:49.109><c> you're</c><00:37:49.259><c> gonna</c><00:37:49.349><c> do</c><00:37:49.789><c> whatever</c><00:37:50.789><c> else</c>

00:37:52.039 --> 00:37:52.049 align:start position:0%
does but just that's gonna be a lot more
 

00:37:52.049 --> 00:37:56.690 align:start position:0%
does but just that's gonna be a lot more
expensive<00:37:52.259><c> to</c><00:37:52.470><c> produce</c><00:37:54.710><c> and</c><00:37:55.710><c> and</c><00:37:56.039><c> and</c><00:37:56.460><c> the</c>

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
expensive to produce and and and the
 

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.910 align:start position:0%
expensive to produce and and and the
hope<00:37:56.910><c> is</c><00:37:57.210><c> which</c><00:37:57.809><c> has</c><00:37:58.049><c> been</c><00:37:58.319><c> somewhat</c><00:37:58.710><c> borne</c>
