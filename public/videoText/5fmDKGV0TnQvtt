instead<00:01:31.229><c> of</c><00:01:31.290><c> this</c><00:01:31.439><c> being</c><00:01:31.619><c> a</c><00:01:31.740><c> passive</c><00:01:32.130><c> process</c>

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
instead of this being a passive process
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 align:start position:0%
instead of this being a passive process
can<00:01:32.549><c> be</c><00:01:32.610><c> active</c><00:01:32.939><c> process</c><00:01:33.299><c> I</c><00:01:33.509><c> think</c><00:01:34.020><c> one</c><00:01:34.110><c> of</c><00:01:34.140><c> the</c>

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 align:start position:0%
can be active process I think one of the
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
can be active process I think one of the
things<00:01:34.470><c> that</c><00:01:34.680><c> like</c><00:01:34.890><c> might</c><00:01:35.520><c> be</c><00:01:35.670><c> hard</c><00:01:35.939><c> for</c>

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 align:start position:0%
things that like might be hard for
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.390 align:start position:0%
things that like might be hard for
people<00:01:36.150><c> to</c><00:01:36.329><c> see</c><00:01:36.509><c> is</c><00:01:36.630><c> like</c><00:01:37.500><c> now</c><00:01:37.710><c> being</c><00:01:38.100><c> in</c><00:01:38.250><c> this</c>

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
people to see is like now being in this
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.010 align:start position:0%
people to see is like now being in this
world<00:01:38.610><c> for</c><00:01:38.850><c> so</c><00:01:39.060><c> long</c><00:01:39.270><c> I</c><00:01:39.450><c> have</c><00:01:39.509><c> a</c><00:01:39.630><c> lot</c><00:01:39.990><c> of</c>

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 align:start position:0%
friends who wanted to do a startup and
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.850 align:start position:0%
friends who wanted to do a startup and
didn't<00:01:42.299><c> know</c><00:01:42.509><c> what</c><00:01:42.720><c> they</c><00:01:42.869><c> wanted</c><00:01:43.110><c> to</c><00:01:43.170><c> do</c><00:01:43.439><c> and</c>

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
didn't know what they wanted to do and
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.710 align:start position:0%
didn't know what they wanted to do and
then<00:01:44.460><c> came</c><00:01:44.790><c> up</c><00:01:44.820><c> with</c><00:01:45.060><c> an</c><00:01:45.149><c> idea</c><00:01:45.270><c> and</c><00:01:45.600><c> we're</c><00:01:45.689><c> very</c>

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
then came up with an idea and we're very
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
then came up with an idea and we're very
successful<00:01:46.470><c> and</c><00:01:46.619><c> so</c><00:01:47.250><c> like</c><00:01:47.399><c> I've</c><00:01:47.579><c> seen</c><00:01:47.880><c> this</c>

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 align:start position:0%
successful and so like I've seen this
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
successful and so like I've seen this
happen<00:01:48.149><c> with</c><00:01:48.570><c> a</c><00:01:48.689><c> lot</c><00:01:48.899><c> of</c><00:01:49.020><c> people</c><00:01:49.320><c> and</c><00:01:49.470><c> so</c>

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
happen with a lot of people and so
 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.260 align:start position:0%
happen with a lot of people and so
that's<00:01:50.250><c> kind</c><00:01:50.430><c> of</c><00:01:50.460><c> where</c><00:01:50.610><c> I've</c><00:01:50.700><c> come</c><00:01:51.060><c> up</c><00:01:51.149><c> with</c>

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I've come up with
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where I've come up with
this<00:01:51.360><c> thought</c><00:01:51.540><c> mm-hmm</c><00:01:52.140><c> so</c><00:01:52.880><c> you</c><00:01:53.880><c> break</c><00:01:54.090><c> it</c><00:01:54.240><c> out</c>

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 align:start position:0%
this thought mm-hmm so you break it out
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.020 align:start position:0%
this thought mm-hmm so you break it out
into<00:01:54.720><c> three</c><00:01:54.990><c> one</c><00:01:55.140><c> two</c><00:01:55.380><c> three</c><00:01:55.680><c> or</c><00:01:56.030><c> several</c>

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 align:start position:0%
into three one two three or several
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.020 align:start position:0%
into three one two three or several
steps<00:01:57.240><c> so</c><00:01:57.829><c> this</c><00:01:58.829><c> is</c><00:01:58.979><c> I'm</c><00:01:59.369><c> gonna</c><00:01:59.490><c> outline</c><00:01:59.790><c> and</c>

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 align:start position:0%
steps so this is I'm gonna outline and
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.090 align:start position:0%
steps so this is I'm gonna outline and
then<00:02:00.119><c> we</c><00:02:00.240><c> can</c><00:02:00.360><c> explain</c><00:02:00.630><c> so</c><00:02:01.500><c> the</c><00:02:01.829><c> order</c><00:02:02.070><c> of</c>

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
then we can explain so the order of
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
then we can explain so the order of
operations<00:02:02.570><c> here's</c><00:02:03.570><c> where</c><00:02:03.750><c> I'd</c><00:02:03.840><c> start</c><00:02:03.960><c> is</c>

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 align:start position:0%
operations here's where I'd start is
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.380 align:start position:0%
operations here's where I'd start is

so<00:05:56.860><c> we</c><00:05:57.430><c> can</c><00:05:57.580><c> apply</c><00:05:57.759><c> either</c><00:05:58.000><c> way</c><00:05:58.120><c> right</c><00:05:58.509><c> and</c>

00:05:58.679 --> 00:05:58.689 align:start position:0%
so we can apply either way right and
 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.179 align:start position:0%
so we can apply either way right and
this<00:05:58.810><c> is</c><00:05:58.930><c> a</c><00:05:58.960><c> very</c><00:05:59.199><c> easy</c><00:05:59.379><c> way</c><00:05:59.620><c> to</c><00:05:59.649><c> get</c><00:05:59.889><c> people</c><00:06:00.129><c> to</c>

a<00:06:12.189><c> problem</c><00:06:12.399><c> find</c><00:06:12.939><c> some</c><00:06:13.120><c> friends</c><00:06:13.449><c> and</c>

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 align:start position:0%
a problem find some friends and
 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
a problem find some friends and
brainstorm<00:06:14.020><c> potential</c><00:06:14.349><c> solutions</c><00:06:14.889><c> to</c><00:06:15.099><c> the</c>

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:15.189 align:start position:0%
brainstorm potential solutions to the

so<00:06:15.729><c> here's</c><00:06:16.029><c> the</c><00:06:16.149><c> trick</c><00:06:19.110><c> you</c><00:06:20.110><c> don't</c><00:06:20.289><c> need</c><00:06:20.379><c> to</c>

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 align:start position:0%
so here's the trick you don't need to
 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
so here's the trick you don't need to
skip<00:06:20.710><c> to</c><00:06:20.889><c> a</c><00:06:20.919><c> solution</c><00:06:21.250><c> too</c><00:06:21.550><c> early</c><00:06:21.849><c> and</c><00:06:22.599><c> your</c>

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 align:start position:0%
skip to a solution too early and your
 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
skip to a solution too early and your
thought<00:06:23.439><c> process</c><00:06:23.979><c> should</c><00:06:24.279><c> be</c><00:06:24.460><c> whatever</c>

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 align:start position:0%
thought process should be whatever
 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.249 align:start position:0%
thought process should be whatever
solution<00:06:25.360><c> I</c><00:06:25.419><c> come</c><00:06:25.629><c> up</c><00:06:25.779><c> with</c><00:06:25.810><c> is</c><00:06:26.020><c> probably</c>

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 align:start position:0%
solution I come up with is probably
 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.249 align:start position:0%
solution I come up with is probably
gonna<00:06:26.379><c> be</c><00:06:26.469><c> wrong</c><00:06:26.939><c> so</c><00:06:27.939><c> well</c><00:06:28.479><c> my</c><00:06:28.599><c> solution</c>

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 align:start position:0%
gonna be wrong so well my solution
 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
gonna be wrong so well my solution
really<00:06:29.620><c> is</c><00:06:29.770><c> is</c><00:06:30.189><c> a</c><00:06:30.610><c> first</c><00:06:31.449><c> hypothesis</c><00:06:32.430><c> and</c>

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 align:start position:0%
really is is a first hypothesis and
 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
really is is a first hypothesis and
