00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 align:start position:0%
should do an event like this and we
 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:50.849 align:start position:0%
should do an event like this and we

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 align:start position:0%
should start doing this as a regular
 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.090 align:start position:0%
should start doing this as a regular
basis<00:01:51.579><c> and</c><00:01:51.700><c> I</c><00:01:51.729><c> said</c><00:01:51.909><c> oh</c><00:01:51.939><c> that's</c><00:01:52.179><c> a</c><00:01:52.270><c> great</c><00:01:52.420><c> idea</c>

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 align:start position:0%

and<00:01:54.100><c> so</c><00:01:54.310><c> here</c><00:01:54.490><c> we</c><00:01:54.579><c> are</c><00:01:54.609><c> here</c><00:01:54.880><c> we</c><00:01:54.909><c> are</c><00:01:55.530><c> so</c><00:01:56.530><c> I</c>

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
and so here we are here we are so I
 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.550 align:start position:0%
and so here we are here we are so I
thought<00:01:56.859><c> I</c><00:01:56.890><c> would</c><00:01:57.039><c> open</c><00:01:57.939><c> a</c><00:01:58.030><c> little</c><00:01:58.179><c> bit</c><00:01:58.560><c> with</c>

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 align:start position:0%
some of the blitzscaling stuff and then
 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.569 align:start position:0%
some of the blitzscaling stuff and then
we'll<00:02:01.600><c> just</c><00:02:01.780><c> kind</c><00:02:01.960><c> of</c><00:02:02.109><c> kick</c><00:02:02.920><c> back</c><00:02:03.070><c> and</c><00:02:03.310><c> forth</c>

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 align:start position:0%
we'll just kind of kick back and forth
 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.929 align:start position:0%
we'll just kind of kick back and forth
right<00:02:03.850><c> okay</c><00:02:04.469><c> so</c><00:02:05.469><c> oh</c><00:02:05.859><c> and</c><00:02:06.340><c> then</c><00:02:06.700><c> the</c><00:02:06.820><c> other</c>

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:11.850 align:start position:0%
company that is not that that is not
 

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.790 align:start position:0%
company that is not that that is not
winning<00:36:12.270><c> sales</c><00:36:12.540><c> is</c><00:36:12.840><c> because</c><00:36:13.440><c> without</c><00:36:13.590><c> that</c>

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
winning sales is because without that
 

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.010 align:start position:0%
winning sales is because without that
then<00:36:14.520><c> all</c><00:36:14.820><c> of</c><00:36:15.000><c> these</c><00:36:15.150><c> problems</c><00:36:15.660><c> of</c><00:36:15.840><c> people</c>

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
then all of these problems of people
 

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
then all of these problems of people

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
and so they don't get caught up in these
turf<00:36:34.470><c> wars</c><00:36:34.710><c> then</c><00:36:35.400><c> it</c><00:36:35.520><c> works</c><00:36:35.760><c> but</c><00:36:36.180><c> I</c><00:36:36.240><c> think</c><00:36:36.650><c> this</c>

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:37.650 align:start position:0%
turf wars then it works but I think this

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:01.570 align:start position:0%
blitzscale can break the company so I
 

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.410 align:start position:0%
blitzscale can break the company so I

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:04.420 align:start position:0%
think the key thing for me is don't try
 

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
think the key thing for me is don't try
to<00:37:04.480><c> do</c><00:37:04.780><c> this</c><00:37:04.960><c> until</c><00:37:05.890><c> you're</c><00:37:06.010><c> confident</c><00:37:06.520><c> you</c>

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:06.670 align:start position:0%
to do this until you're confident you
 

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:09.450 align:start position:0%

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:09.460 align:start position:0%
have this updraft yeah and I think by
 

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.570 align:start position:0%
have this updraft yeah and I think by

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:12.580 align:start position:0%
the way there's a slight bit there's a
 

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
the way there's a slight bit there's a
slight<00:37:12.880><c> kind</c><00:37:13.660><c> of</c><00:37:13.780><c> a</c><00:37:14.040><c> softer</c><00:37:15.040><c> mod</c><00:37:15.220><c> which</c><00:37:16.119><c> is</c>

slight kind of a softer mod which is
