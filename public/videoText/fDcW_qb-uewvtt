we've maximized the friction so we were

we've maximized the friction so we were

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:53.610 align:start position:0%

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
that minimizes the friction rather than

that minimizes the friction rather than

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:57.270 align:start position:0%

there's existential risks that I want to

there's existential risks that I want to
mitigate<00:24:55.070><c> and</c><00:24:55.250><c> so</c><00:24:55.490><c> you</c><00:24:55.850><c> raise</c><00:24:56.030><c> that</c><00:24:56.179><c> round</c><00:24:56.390><c> but</c>

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
mitigate and so you raise that round but
 

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
mitigate and so you raise that round but
at<00:24:57.169><c> the</c><00:24:57.260><c> early</c><00:24:57.530><c> stage</c><00:24:57.770><c> yeah</c><00:24:58.280><c> I</c><00:24:58.460><c> I'm</c><00:24:58.760><c> very</c>

00:24:59.080 --> 00:24:59.090 align:start position:0%

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.549 align:start position:0%
at the early stage yeah I I'm very

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.060 align:start position:0%
don't know why you need it
hmm<00:25:02.570><c> so</c><00:25:02.870><c> in</c><00:25:02.990><c> retrospect</c><00:25:03.320><c> do</c><00:25:03.679><c> you</c><00:25:03.740><c> think</c><00:25:03.830><c> you</c>

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
hmm so in retrospect do you think you
 

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
hmm so in retrospect do you think you
could<00:25:04.220><c> have</c><00:25:04.340><c> like</c><00:25:04.460><c> pulled</c><00:25:05.030><c> it</c><00:25:05.210><c> out</c><00:25:05.299><c> of</c><00:25:05.480><c> the</c>

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:05.570 align:start position:0%
could have like pulled it out of the
 

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.539 align:start position:0%
could have like pulled it out of the

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:07.549 align:start position:0%
tailspin and turned a profitable product
 

00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:09.289 align:start position:0%
out of all the work you put in oh I
 

00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
out of all the work you put in oh I
think<00:25:09.440><c> we</c><00:25:09.650><c> totally</c><00:25:09.890><c> could</c><00:25:10.250><c> have</c><00:25:10.400><c> made</c><00:25:10.640><c> bump</c>

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:11.470 align:start position:0%
think we totally could have made bump
 

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.870 align:start position:0%
think we totally could have made bump
profitable<00:25:12.470><c> I</c><00:25:12.650><c> don't</c><00:25:13.070><c> I</c><00:25:13.220><c> just</c><00:25:13.370><c> did</c><00:25:13.520><c> none</c><00:25:13.760><c> of</c>

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:13.880 align:start position:0%

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.610 align:start position:0%

the<00:25:14.000><c> scale</c><00:25:14.299><c> yeah</c><00:25:14.600><c> like</c><00:25:14.870><c> I</c><00:25:15.080><c> don't</c><00:25:15.320><c> think</c><00:25:15.470><c> we</c>

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:15.620 align:start position:0%
the scale yeah like I don't think we
 

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.870 align:start position:0%
the scale yeah like I don't think we
could<00:25:15.830><c> have</c><00:25:15.919><c> made</c><00:25:15.950><c> it</c><00:25:16.100><c> profitable</c><00:25:16.669><c> at</c><00:25:16.760><c> the</c>

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
could have made it profitable at the
 

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.549 align:start position:0%
could have made it profitable at the

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:19.850 align:start position:0%
injuries and Horowitz needs it to be
 

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.270 align:start position:0%
injuries and Horowitz needs it to be
okay<00:25:20.360><c> so</c><00:25:20.630><c> how</c><00:25:20.840><c> do</c><00:25:20.900><c> we</c><00:25:20.960><c> not</c><00:25:21.200><c> raised</c><00:25:21.500><c> VC</c><00:25:21.919><c> funding</c>

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
okay so how do we not raised VC funding
 

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.289 align:start position:0%
okay so how do we not raised VC funding
I<00:25:22.429><c> think</c><00:25:22.490><c> it</c><00:25:22.730><c> would</c><00:25:22.850><c> have</c><00:25:22.940><c> been</c><00:25:22.970><c> a</c><00:25:23.059><c> great</c>

00:25:23.289 --> 00:25:23.299 align:start position:0%
I think it would have been a great
 

00:25:23.299 --> 00:25:24.909 align:start position:0%
I think it would have been a great
business<00:25:23.450><c> yeah</c><00:25:24.080><c> we</c><00:25:24.320><c> would</c><00:25:24.470><c> have</c><00:25:24.590><c> we</c><00:25:24.890><c> would</c>

00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
business yeah we would have we would
 

00:25:24.919 --> 00:25:27.250 align:start position:0%
business yeah we would have we would
have<00:25:25.039><c> made</c><00:25:25.309><c> a</c><00:25:25.340><c> freemium</c><00:25:26.030><c> model</c><00:25:26.059><c> where</c><00:25:26.600><c> like</c><00:25:26.780><c> 1%</c>

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:27.260 align:start position:0%
have made a freemium model where like 1%
 

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.020 align:start position:0%
have made a freemium model where like 1%
of<00:25:27.320><c> users</c><00:25:27.590><c> bought</c><00:25:27.799><c> that</c><00:25:27.950><c> for</c><00:25:28.250><c> $1</c><00:25:28.520><c> or</c><00:25:28.760><c> something</c>

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:29.030 align:start position:0%
of users bought that for $1 or something
 

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
of users bought that for $1 or something
like<00:25:29.090><c> that</c><00:25:29.150><c> and</c><00:25:29.480><c> it</c><00:25:29.570><c> would</c><00:25:29.659><c> have</c><00:25:29.720><c> been</c><00:25:29.780><c> great</c>

00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:29.929 align:start position:0%
like that and it would have been great
 

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:31.899 align:start position:0%
like that and it would have been great
right<00:25:30.350><c> but</c><00:25:30.770><c> then</c><00:25:30.890><c> it's</c><00:25:31.070><c> also</c><00:25:31.220><c> tricky</c><00:25:31.549><c> going</c>

00:25:31.899 --> 00:25:31.909 align:start position:0%
right but then it's also tricky going
 

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:33.669 align:start position:0%
right but then it's also tricky going
and<00:25:32.090><c> thinking</c><00:25:32.480><c> about</c><00:25:32.659><c> raising</c><00:25:32.809><c> Series</c><00:25:33.289><c> C</c><00:25:33.470><c> for</c>

and thinking about raising Series C for
a<00:25:33.710><c> product</c><00:25:33.950><c> that</c><00:25:34.130><c> also</c><00:25:34.610><c> might</c><00:25:34.789><c> not</c><00:25:34.909><c> be</c>

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
a product that also might not be
 

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.610 align:start position:0%
a product that also might not be

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:36.620 align:start position:0%
profitable at all right yeah so we
 

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:38.110 align:start position:0%
profitable at all right yeah so we
looked<00:25:36.830><c> at</c><00:25:36.950><c> photo</c><00:25:37.220><c> role</c><00:25:37.490><c> and</c><00:25:37.730><c> we</c><00:25:37.850><c> were</c><00:25:37.970><c> like</c>

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
looked at photo role and we were like
 

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.330 align:start position:0%
looked at photo role and we were like
people<00:25:38.990><c> are</c><00:25:39.200><c> gonna</c><00:25:39.289><c> love</c><00:25:39.559><c> this</c><00:25:39.770><c> it's</c><00:25:40.039><c> gonna</c><00:25:40.159><c> be</c>

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:40.340 align:start position:0%
people are gonna love this it's gonna be
 

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.330 align:start position:0%
people are gonna love this it's gonna be
big<00:25:40.549><c> if</c><00:25:40.760><c> we</c><00:25:40.909><c> could</c><00:25:41.090><c> get</c><00:25:41.240><c> it</c><00:25:41.360><c> to</c><00:25:41.480><c> be</c><00:25:41.659><c> like</c>

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:42.340 align:start position:0%
big if we could get it to be like
 

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.590 align:start position:0%
big if we could get it to be like
distributed<00:25:43.340><c> or</c><00:25:43.520><c> part</c><00:25:43.820><c> of</c><00:25:43.940><c> an</c><00:25:44.240><c> operating</c>

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.260 align:start position:0%

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:47.270 align:start position:0%
system like either Apple or Google we
 

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.930 align:start position:0%
system like either Apple or Google we
think<00:25:47.480><c> it</c><00:25:47.600><c> would</c><00:25:47.690><c> be</c><00:25:47.840><c> pretty</c><00:25:47.990><c> big</c><00:25:48.289><c> and</c><00:25:48.940><c> but</c>

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:49.940 align:start position:0%
think it would be pretty big and but
 

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
think it would be pretty big and but
then<00:25:50.090><c> we</c><00:25:50.240><c> were</c><00:25:50.360><c> like</c><00:25:50.480><c> and</c><00:25:50.690><c> that</c><00:25:50.990><c> would</c><00:25:51.140><c> cost</c><00:25:51.289><c> a</c>

00:25:51.399 --> 00:25:51.409 align:start position:0%
then we were like and that would cost a
 

00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:52.570 align:start position:0%
then we were like and that would cost a
lot<00:25:51.530><c> of</c><00:25:51.590><c> money</c><00:25:51.799><c> if</c><00:25:52.070><c> we</c><00:25:52.250><c> were</c><00:25:52.340><c> gonna</c><00:25:52.429><c> do</c><00:25:52.549><c> it</c>

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:52.580 align:start position:0%
lot of money if we were gonna do it
 

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.370 align:start position:0%
lot of money if we were gonna do it
because<00:25:52.789><c> we</c><00:25:53.059><c> wanted</c><00:25:53.299><c> to</c><00:25:53.450><c> store</c><00:25:54.080><c> all</c><00:25:54.260><c> the</c>

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
photos in the cloud and so we like did
 

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
photos in the cloud and so we like did
the<00:25:56.240><c> math</c><00:25:56.450><c> and</c><00:25:56.690><c> we're</c><00:25:56.780><c> like</c><00:25:56.900><c> okay</c><00:25:57.230><c> storing</c><00:25:57.650><c> all</c>

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:57.770 align:start position:0%
the math and we're like okay storing all
 

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.470 align:start position:0%
the math and we're like okay storing all
the<00:25:57.950><c> photos</c><00:25:58.250><c> of</c><00:25:58.370><c> the</c><00:25:58.490><c> world</c><00:25:58.669><c> is</c><00:25:58.940><c> going</c><00:25:59.270><c> to</c><00:25:59.330><c> be</c>

00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
the photos of the world is going to be
 

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.070 align:start position:0%
the photos of the world is going to be
expensive<00:26:00.309><c> and</c><00:26:01.309><c> so</c><00:26:01.850><c> we</c><00:26:01.970><c> kind</c><00:26:02.179><c> of</c><00:26:02.240><c> decided</c><00:26:02.690><c> to</c>

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:04.940 align:start position:0%
do this right you've got to do it in a

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:12.229 align:start position:0%
trajectory for a while beginning with
with<00:27:11.009><c> Picasa</c><00:27:11.339><c> there</c><00:27:11.639><c> was</c><00:27:11.729><c> that</c><00:27:11.789><c> acquisition</c><00:27:12.059><c> I</c>

00:27:12.229 --> 00:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
with Picasa there was that acquisition I
 

00:27:12.239 --> 00:27:14.930 align:start position:0%
with Picasa there was that acquisition I
think<00:27:12.359><c> it</c><00:27:12.419><c> was</c><00:27:12.509><c> in</c><00:27:12.599><c> 2005</c><00:27:13.200><c> to</c><00:27:13.559><c> that</c><00:27:13.679><c> Picasa</c><00:27:14.159><c> and</c>

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
think it was in 2005 to that Picasa and
 

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.539 align:start position:0%
think it was in 2005 to that Picasa and
then<00:27:15.359><c> Picasa</c><00:27:15.719><c> turned</c><00:27:16.289><c> into</c><00:27:16.499><c> Picasa</c><00:27:16.859><c> Web</c><00:27:16.979><c> and</c>

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:17.549 align:start position:0%
then Picasa turned into Picasa Web and
 

00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:19.579 align:start position:0%
then Picasa turned into Picasa Web and
then<00:27:17.789><c> when</c><00:27:18.089><c> Google+</c><00:27:18.599><c> launched</c><00:27:19.049><c> it</c><00:27:19.169><c> got</c><00:27:19.320><c> rolled</c>

00:27:19.579 --> 00:27:19.589 align:start position:0%
then when Google+ launched it got rolled
 

00:27:19.589 --> 00:27:22.339 align:start position:0%
then when Google+ launched it got rolled

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:55.550 align:start position:0%
studied and so they behave differently
 

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:57.910 align:start position:0%

yeah we try to do as much of this as

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:14.230 align:start position:0%
we can use it to give it inputs and then

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%

I think it's an evolutionary thing that
 

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's an evolutionary thing that
those<00:50:52.890><c> of</c><00:50:53.070><c> us</c><00:50:53.160><c> who</c><00:50:53.280><c> had</c><00:50:53.490><c> that</c><00:50:53.670><c> trait</c><00:50:53.970><c> are</c>

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:54.210 align:start position:0%
those of us who had that trait are
 

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:55.970 align:start position:0%
those of us who had that trait are
