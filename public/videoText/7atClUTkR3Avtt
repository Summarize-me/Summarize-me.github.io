00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.330 align:start position:0%
of the watch because it's like a Faraday
cage<00:04:33.210><c> sitting</c><00:04:33.840><c> on</c><00:04:33.930><c> your</c><00:04:34.050><c> wrist</c><00:04:34.289><c> and</c><00:04:34.500><c> so</c><00:04:35.190><c> we</c>

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
cage sitting on your wrist and so we
 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
cage sitting on your wrist and so we

would<00:04:58.470><c> show</c><00:04:58.650><c> us</c><00:04:58.770><c> pictures</c><00:04:58.949><c> of</c><00:04:59.340><c> like</c><00:04:59.460><c> this</c>

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
would show us pictures of like this
 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.820 align:start position:0%
would show us pictures of like this
watch<00:05:00.330><c> the</c><00:05:00.360><c> vigeous</c><00:05:00.870><c> Bob</c><00:05:01.080><c> with</c><00:05:01.259><c> like</c><00:05:01.409><c> the</c><00:05:01.530><c> guts</c>

watch the vigeous Bob with like the guts
 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.490 align:start position:0%
watch the vigeous Bob with like the guts
just<00:05:02.190><c> everywhere</c><00:05:02.819><c> and</c><00:05:03.629><c> so</c><00:05:03.810><c> we</c><00:05:03.960><c> adjusted</c><00:05:04.319><c> the</c>

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
just everywhere and so we adjusted the
 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.510 align:start position:0%
just everywhere and so we adjusted the
thing<00:05:04.680><c> we</c><00:05:04.830><c> started</c><00:05:05.610><c> putting</c><00:05:05.940><c> like</c><00:05:06.240><c> up</c><00:05:06.569><c> like</c><00:05:07.520><c> a</c>

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
thing we started putting like up like a
 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.089 align:start position:0%
thing we started putting like up like a

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
piece of foam rubber inside the watch so
 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.499 align:start position:0%
piece of foam rubber inside the watch so
when<00:05:11.219><c> we</c><00:05:11.310><c> shipped</c><00:05:11.550><c> it</c><00:05:11.669><c> the</c><00:05:11.909><c> the</c><00:05:12.120><c> backswing</c>

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 align:start position:0%
when we shipped it the the backswing
 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.020 align:start position:0%
when we shipped it the the backswing
explode<00:05:13.340><c> but</c><00:05:14.340><c> it</c><00:05:14.400><c> was</c><00:05:14.490><c> a</c><00:05:14.550><c> really</c><00:05:14.729><c> good</c><00:05:14.849><c> thing</c>

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 align:start position:0%
explode but it was a really good thing
 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.339 align:start position:0%
explode but it was a really good thing
that<00:05:15.060><c> we</c><00:05:15.270><c> were</c><00:05:15.360><c> making</c><00:05:15.509><c> them</c><00:05:15.810><c> one</c><00:05:15.960><c> by</c><00:05:16.139><c> one</c><00:05:16.169><c> or</c>

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 align:start position:0%
that we were making them one by one or
 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.350 align:start position:0%
that we were making them one by one or
else<00:05:16.620><c> we</c><00:05:17.099><c> could</c><00:05:17.310><c> have</c><00:05:17.400><c> potentially</c><00:05:17.940><c> made</c><00:05:18.120><c> like</c>

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
else we could have potentially made like
 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.089 align:start position:0%
else we could have potentially made like
hundreds<00:05:18.810><c> with</c><00:05:18.990><c> that</c><00:05:19.110><c> same</c><00:05:19.379><c> problem</c><00:05:19.620><c> right</c><00:05:20.039><c> at</c>

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
hundreds with that same problem right at
 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
hundreds with that same problem right at
the<00:05:20.190><c> beginning</c><00:05:20.280><c> and</c><00:05:20.729><c> had</c><00:05:21.210><c> lost</c><00:05:21.449><c> you</c><00:05:21.840><c> know</c>

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 align:start position:0%
the beginning and had lost you know
 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.399 align:start position:0%
the beginning and had lost you know
so<00:05:22.979><c> we</c><00:05:23.099><c> I</c><00:05:23.340><c> think</c><00:05:23.610><c> we</c><00:05:23.789><c> iterated</c><00:05:24.180><c> really</c><00:05:24.479><c> really</c>

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 align:start position:0%
so we I think we iterated really really
 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.709 align:start position:0%
so we I think we iterated really really
quickly<00:05:25.620><c> and</c><00:05:25.949><c> we</c><00:05:26.129><c> screwed</c><00:05:26.969><c> up</c><00:05:27.120><c> it</c><00:05:27.270><c> was</c><00:05:27.419><c> only</c><00:05:27.599><c> a</c>

and they would ship him down here and we
 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
and they would ship him down here and we
would<00:06:13.349><c> finish</c><00:06:13.560><c> it</c><00:06:13.800><c> in</c><00:06:13.979><c> our</c><00:06:14.190><c> house</c><00:06:14.789><c> that</c><00:06:15.090><c> we</c>

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 align:start position:0%
would finish it in our house that we
 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
would finish it in our house that we
were<00:06:15.599><c> all</c><00:06:15.750><c> living</c><00:06:16.050><c> at</c><00:06:16.169><c> and</c><00:06:17.039><c> so</c><00:06:17.129><c> I</c><00:06:17.159><c> think</c><00:06:17.279><c> the</c>

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 align:start position:0%
were all living at and so I think the
 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.420 align:start position:0%
were all living at and so I think the

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 align:start position:0%
trick there was like we didn't we didn't

the hard
 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.090 align:start position:0%

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:42.460 align:start position:0%
there's two ways that you can do this
 

00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
there's two ways that you can do this

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:44.230 align:start position:0%
one is you can get customers to

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
pre-order that's the easiest way is then
 

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:49.350 align:start position:0%
pre-order that's the easiest way is then
you<00:58:47.800><c> have</c><00:58:47.950><c> a</c><00:58:47.980><c> very</c><00:58:48.040><c> perfect</c><00:58:48.520><c> idea</c><00:58:48.940><c> of</c><00:58:49.000><c> how</c><00:58:49.180><c> many</c>

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:49.360 align:start position:0%

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:52.390 align:start position:0%

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
and you can use that money from
 

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.650 align:start position:0%
