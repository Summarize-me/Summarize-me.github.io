00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
excited it all no it doesn't work and
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.830 align:start position:0%
excited it all no it doesn't work and
then<00:01:29.700><c> it</c><00:01:29.790><c> was</c><00:01:29.909><c> like</c><00:01:30.060><c> wait</c><00:01:30.270><c> we</c><00:01:30.479><c> found</c><00:01:30.689><c> this</c>

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
then it was like wait we found this
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
then it was like wait we found this
weird<00:01:31.020><c> thing</c><00:01:31.290><c> that</c><00:01:31.320><c> actually</c><00:01:31.680><c> makes</c><00:01:31.979><c> it</c><00:01:32.340><c> work</c>

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 align:start position:0%
weird thing that actually makes it work
 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.730 align:start position:0%
weird thing that actually makes it work
great<00:01:32.729><c> so</c><00:01:33.509><c> like</c><00:01:33.689><c> for</c><00:01:33.930><c> VR</c><00:01:34.170><c> it</c><00:01:34.290><c> was</c><00:01:34.409><c> like</c><00:01:34.560><c> cell</c>

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
great so like for VR it was like cell
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 align:start position:0%
great so like for VR it was like cell
phone<00:01:34.920><c> technology</c><00:01:35.159><c> actually</c><00:01:36.000><c> we</c><00:01:36.270><c> have</c><00:01:36.390><c> it</c><00:01:36.479><c> in</c>

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
phone technology actually we have it in
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.700 align:start position:0%
phone technology actually we have it in
our<00:01:36.630><c> pocket</c><00:01:36.990><c> we</c><00:01:37.079><c> can</c><00:01:37.229><c> make</c><00:01:37.350><c> this</c><00:01:37.470><c> stuff</c><00:01:37.650><c> work</c>

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 align:start position:0%
our pocket we can make this stuff work
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
our pocket we can make this stuff work
and<00:01:38.310><c> with</c><00:01:38.490><c> machine</c><00:01:38.759><c> learning</c><00:01:38.790><c> it</c><00:01:39.090><c> was</c><00:01:39.180><c> like</c>

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 align:start position:0%
and with machine learning it was like
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.789 align:start position:0%
and with machine learning it was like
right<00:01:39.509><c> logic</c><00:01:39.930><c> is</c><00:01:40.049><c> wrong</c><00:01:40.200><c> like</c><00:01:40.560><c> there's</c>

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
right logic is wrong like there's
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
right logic is wrong like there's
actually<00:01:40.890><c> preventing</c><00:01:41.729><c> us</c><00:01:41.850><c> from</c><00:01:41.880><c> doing</c><00:01:42.150><c> the</c>

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 align:start position:0%
actually preventing us from doing the
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
actually preventing us from doing the
right<00:01:42.540><c> thing</c><00:01:42.750><c> and</c><00:01:43.020><c> then</c><00:01:43.110><c> teaching</c><00:01:43.829><c> these</c><00:01:43.950><c> you</c>

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 align:start position:0%
right thing and then teaching these you
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 align:start position:0%
right thing and then teaching these you
know<00:01:44.369><c> systems</c><00:01:45.000><c> how</c><00:01:45.090><c> to</c><00:01:45.149><c> learn</c><00:01:45.329><c> and</c><00:01:45.659><c> so</c>

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 align:start position:0%
know systems how to learn and so
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.210 align:start position:0%
know systems how to learn and so
suddenly<00:01:46.439><c> they</c><00:01:46.680><c> both</c><00:01:46.860><c> are</c><00:01:47.009><c> on</c><00:01:47.100><c> this</c>

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
suddenly they both are on this
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 align:start position:0%
suddenly they both are on this

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 align:start position:0%

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 align:start position:0%

didn't have to be boring and it's not
just<00:02:24.770><c> functional</c><00:02:25.220><c> yeah</c><00:02:25.610><c> precisely</c><00:02:25.850><c> like</c>

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 align:start position:0%
just functional yeah precisely like
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
just functional yeah precisely like

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 align:start position:0%
function is actually good because like
 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.860 align:start position:0%
function is actually good because like
films<00:02:28.310><c> actually</c><00:02:28.670><c> serve</c><00:02:28.880><c> a</c><00:02:28.910><c> function</c><00:02:29.510><c> serves</c><00:02:29.660><c> a</c>

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 align:start position:0%
purpose you know and yeah VR could also
 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
purpose you know and yeah VR could also
do<00:02:32.030><c> it</c><00:02:32.120><c> any</c><00:02:32.240><c> sort</c><00:02:32.480><c> of</c><00:02:32.510><c> immersive</c><00:02:32.870><c> content</c><00:02:33.020><c> can</c>

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
do it any sort of immersive content can
 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.170 align:start position:0%
do it any sort of immersive content can
so<00:02:34.010><c> I</c><00:02:34.040><c> thought</c><00:02:34.220><c> it</c><00:02:34.340><c> was</c><00:02:34.430><c> all</c><00:02:34.610><c> and</c><00:02:34.820><c> I</c><00:02:34.850><c> had</c><00:02:34.970><c> before</c>

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 align:start position:0%

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:27.980 align:start position:0%

come to that conclusion if I had made
 

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.539 align:start position:0%
come to that conclusion if I had made
mmediately<00:21:30.169><c> like</c><00:21:30.320><c> volumetric</c><00:21:30.740><c> and</c><00:21:31.190><c> sixth</c><00:21:31.429><c> off</c>

00:21:31.539 --> 00:21:31.549 align:start position:0%
mmediately like volumetric and sixth off
 

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:34.409 align:start position:0%
mmediately like volumetric and sixth off
and<00:21:31.789><c> you</c><00:21:31.850><c> can</c><00:21:32.029><c> you</c><00:21:32.299><c> know</c><00:21:32.330><c> you</c><00:21:32.960><c> can</c><00:21:33.110><c> speak</c><00:21:33.320><c> whale</c>

00:21:34.409 --> 00:21:34.419 align:start position:0%
and you can you know you can speak whale
 

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:36.610 align:start position:0%
and you can you know you can speak whale
so<00:21:35.419><c> for</c><00:21:35.659><c> me</c><00:21:35.779><c> I</c><00:21:35.809><c> think</c><00:21:36.020><c> that</c><00:21:36.110><c> was</c><00:21:36.320><c> it</c><00:21:36.529><c> was</c>

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:36.620 align:start position:0%
so for me I think that was it was
 

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.169 align:start position:0%
so for me I think that was it was
important<00:21:37.010><c> to</c><00:21:37.130><c> have</c><00:21:37.250><c> those</c><00:21:37.429><c> limitations</c><00:21:37.820><c> so</c>

00:21:38.169 --> 00:21:38.179 align:start position:0%
important to have those limitations so
 

00:21:38.179 --> 00:21:40.510 align:start position:0%
important to have those limitations so
that<00:21:38.299><c> I</c><00:21:38.330><c> could</c><00:21:38.570><c> see</c><00:21:39.100><c> within</c><00:21:40.100><c> her</c><00:21:40.279><c> I</c><00:21:40.340><c> could</c>
