00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:02.389 align:start position:0%
it's a turntable was a monster right out

really knew how to look for it but over
 

00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:23.559 align:start position:0%
really knew how to look for it but over

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:23.569 align:start position:0%
time the churn revealed itself and and
 

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:26.799 align:start position:0%
time the churn revealed itself and and
then<00:12:24.379><c> it</c><00:12:24.559><c> you</c><00:12:25.040><c> know</c><00:12:25.069><c> just</c><00:12:25.189><c> could</c><00:12:25.549><c> never</c><00:12:25.809><c> get</c>

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:26.809 align:start position:0%

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:28.459 align:start position:0%
