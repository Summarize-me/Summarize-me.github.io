so that was difficult the thing that we

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:16.870 align:start position:0%
sales was probably our best idea so we
 

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%

00:32:20.159 --> 00:32:20.169 align:start position:0%

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:23.970 align:start position:0%
interesting because you think conversion
is<00:57:22.780><c> such</c><00:57:22.930><c> a</c><00:57:22.960><c> simple</c><00:57:23.260><c> thing</c><00:57:23.560><c> but</c><00:57:23.590><c> it</c><00:57:23.830><c> actually</c>

00:57:23.970 --> 00:57:23.980 align:start position:0%

is such a simple thing but it actually
has<00:57:24.220><c> massive</c><00:57:24.700><c> impact</c>

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:25.150 align:start position:0%
has massive impact
 

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:27.150 align:start position:0%
has massive impact
yeah<00:57:25.240><c> just</c><00:57:25.630><c> like</c><00:57:25.780><c> metric</c><00:57:26.530><c> system</c><00:57:26.860><c> but</c><00:57:27.040><c> it's</c>

helped yeah I think in the early days
 

01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
helped yeah I think in the early days
your<01:02:53.190><c> MVP</c><01:02:53.640><c> should</c><01:02:54.180><c> be</c><01:02:54.330><c> flexible</c><01:02:54.660><c> enough</c><01:02:55.170><c> where</c>

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:56.010 align:start position:0%
your MVP should be flexible enough where
 

01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
your MVP should be flexible enough where
you're<01:02:56.310><c> talking</c><01:02:56.700><c> to</c><01:02:56.790><c> users</c><01:02:57.119><c> and</c><01:02:57.420><c> then</c>

01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:57.930 align:start position:0%
you're talking to users and then
 

01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
you're talking to users and then
planning<01:02:58.200><c> executing</c><01:02:59.099><c> and</c><01:02:59.430><c> then</c><01:02:59.550><c> reiterating</c>

01:03:00.079 --> 01:03:00.089 align:start position:0%
planning executing and then reiterating
 

01:03:00.089 --> 01:03:03.230 align:start position:0%
planning executing and then reiterating
so<01:03:01.050><c> I</c><01:03:01.080><c> think</c><01:03:01.980><c> our</c><01:03:02.099><c> iteration</c><01:03:02.460><c> sorry</c><01:03:02.730><c> and</c><01:03:02.910><c> I</c>

01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
so I think our iteration sorry and I
 

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
so I think our iteration sorry and I
think<01:03:03.660><c> for</c><01:03:03.900><c> us</c><01:03:04.080><c> it's</c><01:03:04.440><c> similar</c><01:03:04.830><c> still</c><01:03:05.310><c> now</c><01:03:05.700><c> and</c>

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:05.970 align:start position:0%
think for us it's similar still now and
 

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:08.390 align:start position:0%
think for us it's similar still now and
were<01:03:06.030><c> three</c><01:03:06.300><c> years</c><01:03:06.420><c> old</c><01:03:06.720><c> but</c><01:03:07.440><c> we</c><01:03:07.680><c> have</c><01:03:08.070><c> the</c>

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
were three years old but we have the
 

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.140 align:start position:0%

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:12.150 align:start position:0%
engineers on a one week cycle and so we
 

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
around transportation and we were kind
 

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.860 align:start position:0%
around transportation and we were kind
of<01:05:16.770><c> like</c><01:05:16.950><c> the</c><01:05:17.430><c> mix</c><01:05:17.700><c> of</c><01:05:17.790><c> both</c><01:05:18.030><c> worlds</c><01:05:18.450><c> so</c><01:05:18.660><c> I</c>

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:18.870 align:start position:0%
of like the mix of both worlds so I
 

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:20.690 align:start position:0%
of like the mix of both worlds so I
thought<01:05:19.560><c> that</c><01:05:19.740><c> was</c><01:05:19.890><c> maybe</c><01:05:20.250><c> one</c><01:05:20.550><c> of</c><01:05:20.580><c> the</c>

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
thought that was maybe one of the
 

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.940 align:start position:0%
thought that was maybe one of the
reasons<01:05:20.730><c> why</c><01:05:21.090><c> in</c><01:05:21.630><c> terms</c><01:05:21.840><c> of</c><01:05:22.080><c> the</c><01:05:22.380><c> space</c><01:05:22.740><c> the</c>

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:22.950 align:start position:0%
reasons why in terms of the space the
 

01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
reasons why in terms of the space the
uniqueness<01:05:23.250><c> of</c><01:05:23.730><c> the</c><01:05:23.880><c> space</c><01:05:24.120><c> and</c><01:05:24.390><c> then</c><01:05:24.480><c> also</c><01:05:24.690><c> I</c>

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:25.650 align:start position:0%
uniqueness of the space and then also I
 

01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
uniqueness of the space and then also I
had<01:05:26.040><c> noticed</c><01:05:26.370><c> why</c><01:05:26.610><c> she</c><01:05:26.790><c> hadn't</c><01:05:27.060><c> funded</c><01:05:27.360><c> a</c><01:05:27.420><c> lot</c>

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:27.450 align:start position:0%
had noticed why she hadn't funded a lot
 

01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:29.330 align:start position:0%
had noticed why she hadn't funded a lot
of<01:05:27.750><c> government</c><01:05:28.290><c> focused</c><01:05:28.590><c> companies</c><01:05:28.950><c> before</c>

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
of government focused companies before
 

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.190 align:start position:0%
of government focused companies before
so<01:05:29.490><c> maybe</c><01:05:29.640><c> maybe</c><01:05:30.420><c> they</c><01:05:30.570><c> took</c><01:05:30.720><c> a</c><01:05:30.780><c> chance</c><01:05:30.960><c> on</c><01:05:31.140><c> us</c>

01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe they took a chance on us
 

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe they took a chance on us
for<01:05:31.500><c> that</c><01:05:31.620><c> I</c><01:05:32.510><c> don't</c><01:05:33.510><c> know</c><01:05:34.050><c> why</c><01:05:34.320><c> you're</c><01:05:34.800><c> gonna</c>

I<01:05:55.339><c> made</c><01:05:56.089><c> sure</c><01:05:56.329><c> that</c><01:05:56.509><c> before</c><01:05:56.930><c> I</c><01:05:56.960><c> applied</c><01:05:57.380><c> to</c><01:05:57.619><c> YC</c>

01:05:58.059 --> 01:05:58.069 align:start position:0%
I made sure that before I applied to YC
 

01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:59.890 align:start position:0%
I made sure that before I applied to YC
I<01:05:58.339><c> had</c><01:05:58.700><c> and</c><01:05:58.940><c> I</c><01:05:58.999><c> was</c><01:05:59.150><c> my</c><01:05:59.299><c> goal</c><01:05:59.509><c> and</c><01:05:59.660><c> I</c><01:05:59.749><c> always</c>

01:05:59.890 --> 01:05:59.900 align:start position:0%
I had and I was my goal and I always
 

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
I had and I was my goal and I always
remember<01:06:00.380><c> this</c><01:06:00.499><c> number</c><01:06:00.920><c> but</c><01:06:01.099><c> it</c><01:06:01.309><c> was</c><01:06:01.430><c> 15</c>

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:02.210 align:start position:0%
remember this number but it was 15
 

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
remember this number but it was 15
customers<01:06:02.450><c> before</c><01:06:03.410><c> I</c><01:06:03.950><c> wrote</c><01:06:04.190><c> my</c><01:06:04.369><c> application</c>

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:04.970 align:start position:0%
customers before I wrote my application
 

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:07.450 align:start position:0%
customers before I wrote my application
and<01:06:05.180><c> so</c><01:06:05.779><c> I</c><01:06:06.109><c> worked</c><01:06:06.499><c> really</c><01:06:06.769><c> really</c><01:06:06.920><c> hard</c><01:06:07.160><c> on</c>

01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:07.460 align:start position:0%
and so I worked really really hard on
 

01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
and so I worked really really hard on
that<01:06:07.640><c> I</c><01:06:07.670><c> hustled</c><01:06:08.359><c> and</c><01:06:08.720><c> I</c><01:06:09.049><c> needed</c><01:06:09.289><c> to</c><01:06:09.410><c> show</c>

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:09.650 align:start position:0%
that I hustled and I needed to show
 

01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:11.710 align:start position:0%
that I hustled and I needed to show
growth<01:06:09.950><c> if</c><01:06:10.279><c> I</c><01:06:10.430><c> was</c><01:06:10.640><c> not</c><01:06:10.940><c> technical</c><01:06:11.450><c> if</c><01:06:11.599><c> I</c>

01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
growth if I was not technical if I
 

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.180 align:start position:0%
growth if I was not technical if I
didn't<01:06:11.989><c> have</c><01:06:12.079><c> another</c><01:06:12.259><c> co-founder</c><01:06:12.859><c> and</c><01:06:13.009><c> so</c><01:06:13.160><c> I</c>

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:13.190 align:start position:0%
didn't have another co-founder and so I
 

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
didn't have another co-founder and so I
think<01:06:13.309><c> that</c><01:06:13.579><c> probably</c><01:06:13.880><c> was</c><01:06:14.299><c> quite</c><01:06:14.479><c> impressive</c>

01:06:14.799 --> 01:06:14.809 align:start position:0%
think that probably was quite impressive
 

01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:16.420 align:start position:0%
think that probably was quite impressive
to<01:06:14.960><c> them</c><01:06:15.170><c> but</c><01:06:15.380><c> yeah</c><01:06:15.890><c> you</c><01:06:15.950><c> would</c><01:06:16.130><c> have</c><01:06:16.160><c> to</c><01:06:16.339><c> ask</c>

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:16.430 align:start position:0%
to them but yeah you would have to ask
 

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:22.660 align:start position:0%
to them but yeah you would have to ask
that<01:06:17.979><c> back</c><01:06:18.979><c> there</c><01:06:20.799><c> so</c><01:06:21.799><c> my</c><01:06:22.009><c> question</c><01:06:22.549><c> is</c>

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:22.670 align:start position:0%
that back there so my question is
 

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:26.259 align:start position:0%
that back there so my question is
focused<01:06:23.299><c> more</c><01:06:23.690><c> towards</c><01:06:23.749><c> the</c><01:06:24.349><c> early</c><01:06:24.559><c> stages</c><01:06:25.269><c> so</c>

01:06:26.259 --> 01:06:26.269 align:start position:0%
focused more towards the early stages so
 

01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:28.690 align:start position:0%
focused more towards the early stages so
you<01:06:27.109><c> know</c><01:06:27.589><c> everything</c><01:06:28.009><c> starts</c><01:06:28.430><c> with</c><01:06:28.519><c> a</c>

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:28.700 align:start position:0%
you know everything starts with a
 

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.059 align:start position:0%
you know everything starts with a
thought<01:06:28.999><c> of</c><01:06:29.269><c> maybe</c><01:06:29.839><c> having</c><01:06:30.140><c> a</c><01:06:30.319><c> new</c><01:06:30.470><c> product</c><01:06:30.829><c> or</c>

01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:33.430 align:start position:0%
thought of maybe having a new product or

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
a new service or something that's
 

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:36.489 align:start position:0%
a new service or something that's

focused towards resolving a problem or
 

01:06:36.499 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
focused towards resolving a problem or
anything<01:06:37.130><c> that</c><01:06:37.369><c> exists</c><01:06:37.910><c> so</c><01:06:39.460><c> with</c><01:06:40.460><c> an</c><01:06:40.609><c> idea</c>

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:41.650 align:start position:0%
anything that exists so with an idea
 

01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:43.779 align:start position:0%
anything that exists so with an idea
there<01:06:42.650><c> can</c><01:06:42.890><c> be</c><01:06:42.920><c> a</c><01:06:43.069><c> period</c><01:06:43.279><c> of</c><01:06:43.519><c> maybe</c>

01:06:43.779 --> 01:06:43.789 align:start position:0%
there can be a period of maybe
 

01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:46.569 align:start position:0%
there can be a period of maybe
stagnation<01:06:44.690><c> and</c><01:06:44.920><c> then</c><01:06:45.920><c> you</c><01:06:46.039><c> have</c><01:06:46.220><c> a</c><01:06:46.249><c> product</c>

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:46.579 align:start position:0%
stagnation and then you have a product
 

01:06:46.579 --> 01:06:48.910 align:start position:0%
stagnation and then you have a product
so<01:06:47.150><c> how</c><01:06:47.329><c> would</c><01:06:47.390><c> you</c><01:06:47.539><c> define</c><01:06:47.779><c> that</c><01:06:48.200><c> stage</c><01:06:48.619><c> or</c>

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
so how would you define that stage or
 

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.489 align:start position:0%
so how would you define that stage or
the<01:06:49.039><c> stages</c><01:06:49.549><c> where</c><01:06:49.729><c> you</c><01:06:49.880><c> you</c><01:06:50.509><c> know</c><01:06:50.539><c> besides</c>

01:06:51.489 --> 01:06:51.499 align:start position:0%
the stages where you you know besides
 

01:06:51.499 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
the stages where you you know besides
the<01:06:51.739><c> leap</c><01:06:51.890><c> of</c><01:06:52.039><c> faith</c><01:06:52.369><c> how</c><01:06:52.910><c> would</c><01:06:53.029><c> you</c><01:06:53.150><c> define</c>

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:53.450 align:start position:0%
the leap of faith how would you define
 

01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:56.979 align:start position:0%
the leap of faith how would you define
that<01:06:54.160><c> transforming</c><01:06:55.160><c> transformation</c><01:06:55.999><c> or</c><01:06:56.269><c> that</c>

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:56.989 align:start position:0%
that transforming transformation or that
 

01:06:56.989 --> 01:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
that transforming transformation or that
transition<01:06:57.589><c> into</c><01:06:58.190><c> a</c><01:06:58.219><c> product</c><01:07:00.579><c> so</c><01:07:01.579><c> I</c><01:07:01.789><c> think</c><01:07:01.910><c> the</c>

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:02.210 align:start position:0%
transition into a product so I think the
 

01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:05.289 align:start position:0%
transition into a product so I think the
question<01:07:02.390><c> in</c><01:07:02.779><c> a</c><01:07:02.839><c> nutshell</c><01:07:03.049><c> is</c><01:07:03.969><c> it</c><01:07:04.969><c> can</c><01:07:05.150><c> take</c><01:07:05.180><c> a</c>

01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:05.299 align:start position:0%
question in a nutshell is it can take a
 

01:07:05.299 --> 01:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
question in a nutshell is it can take a
lot<01:07:05.539><c> of</c><01:07:05.569><c> time</c><01:07:05.839><c> to</c><01:07:06.289><c> get</c><01:07:06.469><c> good</c><01:07:06.829><c> feedback</c><01:07:07.359><c> to</c><01:07:08.359><c> get</c>

01:07:09.779 --> 01:07:09.789 align:start position:0%
lot of time to get good feedback to get
 

01:07:09.789 --> 01:07:11.499 align:start position:0%
lot of time to get good feedback to get
customers<01:07:10.789><c> I</c><01:07:10.849><c> tell</c><01:07:10.999><c> you</c><01:07:11.119><c> there</c><01:07:11.299><c> you're</c>

01:07:11.499 --> 01:07:11.509 align:start position:0%
customers I tell you there you're
 

01:07:11.509 --> 01:07:13.420 align:start position:0%

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
actually onto something so how do you go
 

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:14.620 align:start position:0%
actually onto something so how do you go
through<01:07:13.670><c> the</c><01:07:13.969><c> product</c><01:07:14.210><c> development</c><01:07:14.539><c> cycle</c>

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.930 align:start position:0%
through the product development cycle
and<01:07:15.109><c> iterate</c><01:07:15.529><c> through</c><01:07:16.069><c> all</c><01:07:16.160><c> that</c><01:07:16.489><c> you</c><01:07:16.849><c> know</c>

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:16.940 align:start position:0%

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:19.450 align:start position:0%
and iterate through all that you know
long<01:07:17.390><c> periods</c><01:07:17.869><c> of</c><01:07:18.049><c> no</c><01:07:18.799><c> maybe</c><01:07:19.130><c> no</c><01:07:19.309><c> good</c>

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:22.029 align:start position:0%
long periods of no maybe no good
feedback<01:07:20.349><c> yeah</c><01:07:21.349><c> so</c><01:07:21.499><c> I</c><01:07:21.529><c> think</c><01:07:21.619><c> this</c><01:07:21.799><c> is</c><01:07:21.859><c> really</c>

01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:23.589 align:start position:0%
feedback yeah so I think this is really
hard<01:07:22.400><c> and</c><01:07:22.670><c> I</c><01:07:22.789><c> think</c><01:07:22.819><c> kind</c><01:07:23.119><c> of</c><01:07:23.180><c> people</c><01:07:23.450><c> don't</c>

01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
hard and I think kind of people don't
 

01:07:23.599 --> 01:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
hard and I think kind of people don't
talk<01:07:23.779><c> about</c><01:07:23.930><c> it</c><01:07:24.140><c> enough</c><01:07:24.380><c> I</c><01:07:24.890><c> think</c><01:07:25.190><c> there's</c><01:07:25.430><c> a</c>

01:07:25.479 --> 01:07:25.489 align:start position:0%
talk about it enough I think there's a
 

01:07:25.489 --> 01:07:27.700 align:start position:0%
talk about it enough I think there's a
lot<01:07:25.609><c> of</c><01:07:25.640><c> like</c><01:07:25.880><c> you</c><01:07:26.509><c> tell</c><01:07:26.749><c> people</c><01:07:27.170><c> or</c><01:07:27.440><c> when</c><01:07:27.589><c> we</c>

01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:28.290 align:start position:0%
think we've ever I could ever go through
it<01:19:27.040><c> again</c><01:19:27.130><c> like</c><01:19:27.580><c> I</c><01:19:27.730><c> don't</c><01:19:27.790><c> know</c><01:19:27.970><c> how</c><01:19:28.090><c> we</c><01:19:28.150><c> were</c>

01:19:28.290 --> 01:19:28.300 align:start position:0%
it again like I don't know how we were
 

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
it again like I don't know how we were
so<01:19:28.510><c> naive</c><01:19:28.660><c> to</c><01:19:28.870><c> think</c><01:19:29.050><c> that</c><01:19:29.290><c> we</c><01:19:29.530><c> could</c><01:19:29.710><c> do</c><01:19:29.890><c> it</c>

01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:30.070 align:start position:0%
so naive to think that we could do it
 

01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:34.430 align:start position:0%
so naive to think that we could do it
but<01:19:30.790><c> we</c><01:19:30.910><c> worked</c><01:19:31.090><c> really</c><01:19:31.360><c> really</c><01:19:31.480><c> hard</c><01:19:31.780><c> and</c><01:19:32.910><c> I</c>

01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
but we worked really really hard and I
 

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:37.470 align:start position:0%
but we worked really really hard and I
think<01:19:35.440><c> that</c><01:19:35.650><c> for</c><01:19:36.190><c> us</c><01:19:36.310><c> looking</c><01:19:36.670><c> back</c><01:19:36.970><c> the</c><01:19:37.270><c> thing</c>

01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
think that for us looking back the thing
 

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.510 align:start position:0%
think that for us looking back the thing
that<01:19:37.660><c> would</c><01:19:37.840><c> really</c><01:19:38.070><c> helpful</c><01:19:39.070><c> during</c><01:19:39.220><c> that</c>

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
that would really helpful during that
 

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.970 align:start position:0%

01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:16.780 align:start position:0%
we added an antenna because just it was

so<01:28:29.710><c> we</c><01:28:30.310><c> called</c><01:28:30.550><c> it</c><01:28:30.700><c> like</c><01:28:30.850><c> White</c><01:28:31.090><c> Glove</c><01:28:31.210><c> service</c>

01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
so we called it like White Glove service
 

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
so we called it like White Glove service
because<01:28:32.290><c> it</c><01:28:32.770><c> was</c><01:28:32.950><c> the</c><01:28:33.070><c> CTO</c><01:28:33.430><c> taking</c><01:28:33.970><c> care</c><01:28:34.120><c> of</c>

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:34.150 align:start position:0%
because it was the CTO taking care of
 

01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:36.690 align:start position:0%
because it was the CTO taking care of

01:28:36.690 --> 01:28:36.700 align:start position:0%
all these bugs but we really learned a
 

01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
all these bugs but we really learned a

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:39.130 align:start position:0%
lot and the other thing that changed for
 

01:28:39.130 --> 01:28:41.070 align:start position:0%
lot and the other thing that changed for
us<01:28:39.190><c> was</c><01:28:39.550><c> the</c><01:28:39.670><c> way</c><01:28:39.760><c> we</c><01:28:39.970><c> approached</c><01:28:40.300><c> growth</c><01:28:40.630><c> so</c>

01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
us was the way we approached growth so
 

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:44.010 align:start position:0%
us was the way we approached growth so
we<01:28:41.110><c> started</c><01:28:41.860><c> measuring</c><01:28:42.190><c> growth</c><01:28:42.550><c> weekly</c><01:28:43.090><c> so</c><01:28:43.660><c> we</c>

01:28:44.010 --> 01:28:44.020 align:start position:0%
we started measuring growth weekly so we
 

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:45.930 align:start position:0%
we started measuring growth weekly so we
had<01:28:44.200><c> the</c><01:28:44.740><c> spike</c><01:28:45.010><c> in</c><01:28:45.190><c> pre-orders</c><01:28:45.640><c> and</c><01:28:45.850><c> then</c>

01:28:45.930 --> 01:28:45.940 align:start position:0%
had the spike in pre-orders and then
 

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.850 align:start position:0%
had the spike in pre-orders and then
everything<01:28:46.360><c> started</c><01:28:46.630><c> dying</c><01:28:46.900><c> and</c><01:28:47.260><c> so</c><01:28:47.410><c> they</c>

01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:47.860 align:start position:0%
everything started dying and so they
 

01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.290 align:start position:0%
everything started dying and so they
really<01:28:48.070><c> invited</c><01:28:48.430><c> us</c><01:28:48.550><c> to</c><01:28:48.670><c> think</c><01:28:48.850><c> about</c><01:28:49.060><c> it</c><01:28:49.180><c> is</c>

01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:49.300 align:start position:0%
really invited us to think about it is
 

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.330 align:start position:0%
really invited us to think about it is

there are things that you kind of have
to<01:46:24.719><c> do</c><01:46:24.869><c> that</c><01:46:25.079><c> are</c><01:46:25.199><c> you</c><01:46:25.590><c> just</c><01:46:25.770><c> run</c><01:46:25.920><c> out</c><01:46:26.040><c> of</c><01:46:26.070><c> time</c>

01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:26.340 align:start position:0%

definitely did not feel that way and so
I<01:49:41.340><c> just</c><01:49:41.550><c> I</c><01:49:41.760><c> think</c><01:49:42.060><c> it's</c><01:49:42.270><c> really</c><01:49:42.390><c> important</c><01:49:43.020><c> to</c>

03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:55.301 align:start position:0%

03:00:55.301 --> 03:00:55.311 align:start position:0%
then like engineers we've talked to in
 

03:00:55.311 --> 03:00:57.131 align:start position:0%
then like engineers we've talked to in
the<03:00:55.340><c> community</c><03:00:55.660><c> it</c><03:00:56.660><c> could</c><03:00:56.750><c> be</c><03:00:56.840><c> quite</c><03:00:56.931><c> a</c><03:00:57.050><c> bit</c>

03:00:57.131 --> 03:00:57.141 align:start position:0%
the community it could be quite a bit
 

03:00:57.141 --> 03:00:58.870 align:start position:0%
the community it could be quite a bit

03:00:58.870 --> 03:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
and so there's waste of time as far as
 

03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:00.690 align:start position:0%
and so there's waste of time as far as
like<03:00:59.090><c> going</c><03:00:59.540><c> to</c><03:00:59.690><c> different</c><03:01:00.141><c> destinations</c>

03:01:00.690 --> 03:01:00.700 align:start position:0%

03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:03.700 align:start position:0%
like going to different destinations
there's<03:01:01.700><c> also</c><03:01:01.851><c> that</c><03:01:02.690><c> context</c><03:01:03.320><c> switching</c>

03:01:03.700 --> 03:01:03.710 align:start position:0%
there's also that context switching
