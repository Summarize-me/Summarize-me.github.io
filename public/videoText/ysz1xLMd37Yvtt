well<00:00:26.640><c> uh</c><00:00:27.300><c> this</c><00:00:27.599><c> room</c>

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
well uh this room
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.609 align:start position:0%
well uh this room
um<00:00:29.300><c> uh</c><00:00:30.300><c> actually</c><00:00:30.480><c> may</c><00:00:31.019><c> actually</c><00:00:31.260><c> agree</c><00:00:31.560><c> with</c>

um uh actually may actually agree with
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.110 align:start position:0%
um uh actually may actually agree with
this<00:00:31.800><c> but</c><00:00:31.980><c> I</c><00:00:32.099><c> think</c><00:00:32.160><c> this</c><00:00:32.279><c> is</c><00:00:32.460><c> and</c><00:00:32.700><c> when</c><00:00:32.940><c> you</c>

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
this but I think this is and when you
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.729 align:start position:0%
this but I think this is and when you
count<00:00:33.300><c> the</c><00:00:33.480><c> globe</c><00:00:33.780><c> that</c><00:00:34.200><c> question</c><00:00:34.320><c> about</c><00:00:34.620><c> the</c>

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
count the globe that question about the
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.350 align:start position:0%
count the globe that question about the
globe<00:00:34.920><c> not</c><00:00:35.160><c> the</c><00:00:35.280><c> globe</c><00:00:35.520><c> that</c><00:00:36.000><c> question</c><00:00:36.180><c> always</c>

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
globe not the globe that question always
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.290 align:start position:0%
globe not the globe that question always
has<00:00:36.600><c> to</c><00:00:36.719><c> be</c><00:00:36.840><c> indexed</c><00:00:37.260><c> against</c><00:00:37.440><c> the</c><00:00:37.739><c> population</c>

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 align:start position:0%
has to be indexed against the population
 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.690 align:start position:0%
has to be indexed against the population
but<00:00:39.300><c> what</c><00:00:39.540><c> I</c><00:00:39.719><c> would</c><00:00:39.780><c> say</c><00:00:39.960><c> is</c><00:00:40.260><c> that</c><00:00:40.800><c> uh</c><00:00:41.340><c> we</c><00:00:41.520><c> have</c>

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
but what I would say is that uh we have
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.450 align:start position:0%
but what I would say is that uh we have
an<00:00:42.000><c> extremely</c><00:00:42.899><c> high</c><00:00:43.200><c> likelihood</c><00:00:43.739><c> that</c><00:00:44.160><c> within</c>

this room normally tend to think that's

this room normally tend to think that's
artificial<00:00:56.280><c> intelligence</c><00:00:56.760><c> but</c><00:00:57.539><c> I</c><00:00:57.660><c> actually</c>

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence but I actually
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.569 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence but I actually
think<00:00:58.020><c> it's</c><00:00:58.140><c> a</c><00:00:58.320><c> jump</c><00:00:58.440><c> ball</c><00:00:58.680><c> between</c><00:00:59.039><c> that</c><00:00:59.399><c> and</c>

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 align:start position:0%
think it's a jump ball between that and
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.889 align:start position:0%
think it's a jump ball between that and
a<00:00:59.760><c> different</c><00:00:59.820><c> version</c><00:01:00.059><c> of</c><00:01:00.239><c> the</c><00:01:00.300><c> homogeneous</c>

a different version of the homogeneous
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 align:start position:0%
a different version of the homogeneous

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
homogeneous because there was florenceis
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.850 align:start position:0%

and<00:01:09.060><c> Neanderthal</c><00:01:09.600><c> and</c><00:01:09.840><c> so</c><00:01:10.020><c> forth</c><00:01:10.260><c> and</c><00:01:10.439><c> when</c>

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
and Neanderthal and so forth and when
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 align:start position:0%
and Neanderthal and so forth and when
you<00:01:10.979><c> consider</c><00:01:11.400><c> longer</c><00:01:11.880><c> time</c><00:01:12.180><c> frame</c><00:01:12.479><c> it's</c>

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 align:start position:0%
you consider longer time frame it's
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.750 align:start position:0%
you consider longer time frame it's
actually<00:01:12.900><c> 40</c><00:01:13.320><c> 50</c><00:01:13.860><c> 000</c><00:01:13.979><c> years</c><00:01:14.100><c> ago</c><00:01:14.340><c> is</c><00:01:14.520><c> actually</c>

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
actually 40 50 000 years ago is actually
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 align:start position:0%
actually 40 50 000 years ago is actually
not<00:01:15.000><c> that</c><00:01:15.180><c> long</c><00:01:15.420><c> ago</c>

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
not that long ago
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.770 align:start position:0%
not that long ago
so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.570 align:start position:0%
so
um<00:01:18.840><c> uh</c><00:01:19.500><c> so</c><00:01:19.680><c> I</c><00:01:19.740><c> think</c><00:01:19.860><c> we're</c><00:01:19.979><c> going</c><00:01:20.159><c> to</c><00:01:20.220><c> do</c><00:01:20.340><c> that</c>

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
um uh so I think we're going to do that
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.830 align:start position:0%
um uh so I think we're going to do that
and<00:01:21.060><c> it's</c><00:01:21.540><c> a</c><00:01:21.720><c> in</c><00:01:22.200><c> it's</c><00:01:22.680><c> conditioned</c><00:01:23.400><c> upon</c><00:01:23.840><c> uh</c>

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a in it's conditioned upon uh
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.990 align:start position:0%
and it's a in it's conditioned upon uh
are<00:01:25.140><c> the</c><00:01:25.380><c> particular</c><00:01:25.740><c> breakthroughs</c><00:01:26.460><c> in</c><00:01:26.640><c> AI</c>

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
are the particular breakthroughs in AI
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.749 align:start position:0%
are the particular breakthroughs in AI
which<00:01:27.299><c> I</c><00:01:27.420><c> think</c><00:01:27.540><c> there</c><00:01:27.780><c> is</c><00:01:27.900><c> still</c><00:01:28.080><c> some</c>

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 align:start position:0%
which I think there is still some

I<00:02:08.580><c> guess</c><00:02:08.819><c> uh</c>

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
I guess uh
 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.290 align:start position:0%
I guess uh
uh

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.449 align:start position:0%
uh
well<00:02:12.720><c> this</c><00:02:13.020><c> might</c><00:02:13.200><c> be</c><00:02:13.379><c> they</c><00:02:13.739><c> hadn't</c><00:02:14.280><c> thought</c>

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 align:start position:0%
well this might be they hadn't thought
 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.830 align:start position:0%
well this might be they hadn't thought
about<00:02:14.640><c> it</c>

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
about it
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.650 align:start position:0%
about it
um<00:02:15.959><c> I</c><00:02:16.680><c> think</c><00:02:17.160><c> that</c><00:02:17.459><c> one</c><00:02:17.700><c> of</c><00:02:17.819><c> the</c><00:02:17.940><c> things</c><00:02:18.180><c> that's</c>

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I think that one of the things that's
 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.070 align:start position:0%
um I think that one of the things that's
actually<00:02:18.959><c> really</c><00:02:19.379><c> important</c><00:02:20.180><c> for</c><00:02:21.180><c> inventing</c>

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.470 align:start position:0%

is<00:02:24.540><c> a</c><00:02:25.020><c> fairly</c><00:02:25.379><c> deep</c><00:02:25.739><c> sense</c><00:02:26.160><c> of</c><00:02:26.700><c> a</c><00:02:26.879><c> theory</c><00:02:27.180><c> of</c>

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.430 align:start position:0%

and<00:02:29.940><c> so</c><00:02:30.120><c> I</c><00:02:30.300><c> think</c><00:02:30.420><c> that</c><00:02:30.660><c> anyone</c><00:02:31.020><c> who</c><00:02:31.319><c> is</c>

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.350 align:start position:0%
that are the opposite of mistakes that
lead<00:03:54.840><c> them</c><00:03:55.019><c> to</c><00:03:55.260><c> Great</c><00:03:55.500><c> results</c><00:03:56.060><c> so</c><00:03:57.060><c> I</c><00:03:57.180><c> think</c>

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
one of the let's see uh we could
 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.890 align:start position:0%
one of the let's see uh we could
probably<00:03:59.940><c> spend</c><00:04:00.180><c> the</c><00:04:00.299><c> whole</c><00:04:00.480><c> half</c><00:04:00.659><c> hour</c>

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
probably spend the whole half hour
 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.350 align:start position:0%
probably spend the whole half hour
entirely<00:04:01.560><c> on</c><00:04:01.799><c> this</c><00:04:01.980><c> but</c><00:04:02.280><c> I'll</c><00:04:02.700><c> try</c><00:04:02.819><c> to</c><00:04:02.879><c> do</c><00:04:03.000><c> so</c><00:04:03.239><c> I</c>

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
entirely on this but I'll try to do so I
 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.670 align:start position:0%
entirely on this but I'll try to do so I
gave<00:04:03.480><c> you</c><00:04:03.599><c> all</c><00:04:03.659><c> three</c><00:04:03.840><c> questions</c><00:04:03.959><c> up</c><00:04:04.319><c> front</c><00:04:04.500><c> so</c>

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
gave you all three questions up front so
 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.830 align:start position:0%
gave you all three questions up front so
you<00:04:04.799><c> could</c><00:04:04.920><c> allocate</c><00:04:05.280><c> time</c><00:04:05.459><c> yes</c>

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
you could allocate time yes
 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.949 align:start position:0%
you could allocate time yes
um<00:04:06.900><c> so</c><00:04:07.140><c> one</c><00:04:07.379><c> thing</c><00:04:07.500><c> is</c><00:04:08.180><c> build</c><00:04:09.180><c> the</c><00:04:09.540><c> strongest</c>

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
um so one thing is build the strongest
 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.390 align:start position:0%
