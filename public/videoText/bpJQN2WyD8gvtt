00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:30.879 align:start position:0%

you<00:09:31.660><c> know</c><00:09:31.749><c> there's</c><00:09:32.259><c> a</c><00:09:32.319><c> lot</c><00:09:32.649><c> that</c><00:09:32.919><c> goes</c><00:09:32.980><c> into</c>

00:09:33.449 --> 00:09:33.459 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot that goes into
 

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:37.530 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot that goes into
execution<00:09:34.350><c> and</c><00:09:35.850><c> and</c><00:09:36.850><c> sometimes</c><00:09:37.209><c> you</c><00:09:37.389><c> know</c><00:09:37.509><c> a</c>

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:37.540 align:start position:0%
execution and and sometimes you know a
 

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.009 align:start position:0%
execution and and sometimes you know a
good<00:09:37.749><c> idea</c><00:09:37.809><c> is</c><00:09:38.139><c> just</c><00:09:38.169><c> badly</c><00:09:38.529><c> executed</c><00:09:39.269><c> and</c><00:09:40.269><c> so</c>

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:41.019 align:start position:0%
good idea is just badly executed and so
 

00:09:41.019 --> 00:09:43.669 align:start position:0%
good idea is just badly executed and so
yeah<00:09:41.919><c> just</c><00:09:42.220><c> follow</c><00:09:42.639><c> but</c><00:09:42.999><c> don't</c><00:09:43.179><c> copy</c>

00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
yeah just follow but don't copy
 

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
yeah just follow but don't copy
necessarily<00:09:45.029><c> so</c><00:09:46.029><c> is</c><00:09:47.019><c> it</c><00:09:47.259><c> more</c><00:09:47.559><c> important</c><00:09:48.069><c> to</c>

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:48.369 align:start position:0%
necessarily so is it more important to
 

00:09:48.369 --> 00:09:56.030 align:start position:0%
necessarily so is it more important to

especially like for myself I went

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:10.110 align:start position:0%
just nothingness and so I was always the
 

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.620 align:start position:0%
just nothingness and so I was always the
one<00:22:10.380><c> coding</c><00:22:10.890><c> and</c><00:22:11.040><c> building</c><00:22:11.280><c> the</c><00:22:11.370><c> product</c><00:22:11.730><c> and</c>

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:12.630 align:start position:0%
one coding and building the product and
 

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.570 align:start position:0%
one coding and building the product and
then<00:22:12.780><c> as</c><00:22:12.990><c> my</c><00:22:13.350><c> company</c><00:22:13.830><c> starts</c><00:22:14.160><c> scaling</c><00:22:14.460><c> up</c>

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
then as my company starts scaling up
 

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.150 align:start position:0%
then as my company starts scaling up
fast<00:22:14.820><c> I</c><00:22:15.090><c> cut</c><00:22:15.300><c> I</c><00:22:15.420><c> didn't</c><00:22:16.380><c> let</c><00:22:16.560><c> go</c><00:22:16.620><c> that</c><00:22:16.890><c> stuff</c>

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:17.160 align:start position:0%

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:19.410 align:start position:0%
fast enough so I think there's a lot to
 

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.470 align:start position:0%
fast enough so I think there's a lot to

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
learn in terms of scaling a company and
 

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
