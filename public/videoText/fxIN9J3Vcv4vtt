not<00:14:45.410><c> only</c><00:14:45.620><c> because</c><00:14:46.100><c> it</c><00:14:46.250><c> would</c><00:14:46.339><c> take</c><00:14:46.519><c> me</c><00:14:46.579><c> longer</c>

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:46.940 align:start position:0%

than<00:14:47.269><c> a</c><00:14:47.300><c> week</c><00:14:47.480><c> but</c><00:14:48.079><c> also</c><00:14:48.319><c> because</c><00:14:48.920><c> I</c><00:14:49.279><c> had</c><00:14:49.639><c> no</c>

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:49.790 align:start position:0%

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.430 align:start position:0%
than a week but also because I had no
idea<00:14:49.940><c> we</c><00:14:50.269><c> had</c><00:14:50.300><c> 60</c><00:14:50.720><c> leaders</c><00:14:51.019><c> in</c><00:14:51.199><c> the</c><00:14:51.290><c> company</c>
