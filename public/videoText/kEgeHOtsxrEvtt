00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 align:start position:0%

way of trying to deal with it is
 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.089 align:start position:0%
way of trying to deal with it is

collecting more diverse data okay but

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 align:start position:0%
one of the big problems is when you do

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 align:start position:0%
that you end up collecting lots and lots
 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.740 align:start position:0%

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
process you show it an image you ask it
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
process you show it an image you ask it

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
make it look more like what you think
 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 align:start position:0%
you edit the image slightly you keep

around adversarial data right yeah
 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
around adversarial data right yeah
that's<00:05:25.780><c> right</c><00:05:25.990><c> so</c><00:05:26.229><c> I</c><00:05:26.259><c> mean</c><00:05:26.919><c> I</c><00:05:26.949><c> think</c><00:05:27.099><c> it</c><00:05:27.310><c> has</c><00:05:27.400><c> a</c>

that's right so I mean I think it has a

that's right so I mean I think it has a

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:32.810 align:start position:0%
and like that's like a huge task and so
 

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:34.420 align:start position:0%

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:10.529 align:start position:0%
still like so I mean like cloud services
 

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
still like so I mean like cloud services
will<00:11:10.709><c> have</c><00:11:10.829><c> the</c><00:11:10.949><c> same</c><00:11:11.129><c> impact</c><00:11:11.399><c> on</c><00:11:11.609><c> the</c><00:11:11.699><c> economy</c>

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:12.089 align:start position:0%
will have the same impact on the economy
 

00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:13.879 align:start position:0%
will have the same impact on the economy
they<00:11:12.299><c> always</c><00:11:12.540><c> have</c><00:11:12.749><c> right</c><00:11:13.079><c> and</c><00:11:13.319><c> I</c><00:11:13.589><c> think</c><00:11:13.769><c> this</c>

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:13.889 align:start position:0%
they always have right and I think this
 

00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:15.019 align:start position:0%
they always have right and I think this
is<00:11:13.980><c> one</c><00:11:14.160><c> initiative</c><00:11:14.429><c> because</c><00:11:14.639><c> all</c><00:11:14.879><c> these</c>

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:15.029 align:start position:0%
is one initiative because all these
 

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:17.449 align:start position:0%
is one initiative because all these

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:20.189 align:start position:0%

00:11:20.189 --> 00:11:21.739 align:start position:0%
cloud ml services yeah and the upshot of
that<00:11:20.369><c> basically</c><00:11:20.730><c> is</c><00:11:20.910><c> that</c><00:11:20.939><c> the</c><00:11:21.179><c> like</c><00:11:21.389><c> amount</c>

00:11:21.739 --> 00:11:21.749 align:start position:0%
that basically is that the like amount

that basically is that the like amount

00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
of like you don't need a PhD in machine
 

00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:24.769 align:start position:0%
of like you don't need a PhD in machine
learning<00:11:23.730><c> to</c><00:11:23.939><c> get</c><00:11:24.059><c> all</c><00:11:24.179><c> the</c><00:11:24.299><c> benefits</c><00:11:24.689><c> from</c>

00:11:26.359 --> 00:11:26.369 align:start position:0%
machine learning right and I think that
 

00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:28.609 align:start position:0%
machine learning right and I think that
will<00:11:26.790><c> shape</c><00:11:27.089><c> the</c><00:11:27.239><c> space</c><00:11:27.299><c> for</c><00:11:27.779><c> sure</c><00:11:27.929><c> okay</c><00:11:28.379><c> yeah</c>

00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:28.619 align:start position:0%
will shape the space for sure okay yeah
 

00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:30.499 align:start position:0%
will shape the space for sure okay yeah

well so I think I'm the other thing
 

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:41.479 align:start position:0%
well so I think I'm the other thing
we're<00:11:40.019><c> really</c><00:11:40.169><c> interested</c><00:11:40.649><c> in</c><00:11:40.769><c> and</c><00:11:41.339><c> I'm</c>

00:11:41.479 --> 00:11:41.489 align:start position:0%
we're really interested in and I'm

it<00:11:44.100><c> possible</c><00:11:44.549><c> to</c><00:11:44.730><c> pull</c><00:11:45.029><c> off</c><00:11:45.239><c> machine</c><00:11:45.660><c> learning</c>

00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
it possible to pull off machine learning
 

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:48.409 align:start position:0%
it possible to pull off machine learning

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:20.249 align:start position:0%
well you could have it physically run
 

00:12:20.249 --> 00:12:21.889 align:start position:0%
well you could have it physically run

through that maze millions of times or
 

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:23.389 align:start position:0%
through that maze millions of times or
you<00:12:22.199><c> could</c><00:12:22.319><c> just</c><00:12:22.350><c> have</c><00:12:22.559><c> a</c><00:12:22.589><c> virtual</c><00:12:22.860><c> 3d</c>

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
you could just have a virtual 3d

you could just have a virtual 3d
environment<00:12:24.389><c> that</c><00:12:24.809><c> you</c><00:12:24.869><c> cause</c><00:12:25.110><c> a</c><00:12:25.139><c> computer</c><00:12:25.649><c> to</c>

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:25.769 align:start position:0%
environment that you cause a computer to
 

00:12:25.769 --> 00:12:27.379 align:start position:0%
environment that you cause a computer to

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:27.389 align:start position:0%
run through and it learns how to do that
 

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:29.269 align:start position:0%
run through and it learns how to do that
in<00:12:27.540><c> virtual</c><00:12:27.899><c> space</c><00:12:28.169><c> and</c><00:12:28.470><c> then</c><00:12:28.799><c> basically</c><00:12:29.129><c> you</c>

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
in virtual space and then basically you
 

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:32.989 align:start position:0%
in virtual space and then basically you
put<00:12:29.999><c> it</c><00:12:30.089><c> into</c><00:12:30.419><c> in</c><00:12:31.259><c> practice</c><00:12:31.829><c> in</c><00:12:32.069><c> a</c><00:12:32.459><c> real</c><00:12:32.639><c> robot</c>

00:12:32.989 --> 00:12:32.999 align:start position:0%
put it into in practice in a real robot
 

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:34.609 align:start position:0%
put it into in practice in a real robot
and<00:12:33.299><c> so</c><00:12:33.720><c> that's</c><00:12:33.869><c> a</c><00:12:33.959><c> really</c><00:12:34.139><c> another</c><00:12:34.290><c> exciting</c>

00:12:34.609 --> 00:12:34.619 align:start position:0%

00:12:34.619 --> 00:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
and so that's a really another exciting

00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:36.329 align:start position:0%
where we don't necessarily need like an

with some of these models and I think
 

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.310 align:start position:0%
with some of these models and I think
they've<00:14:36.090><c> got</c><00:14:36.240><c> a</c><00:14:36.300><c> couple</c><00:14:36.660><c> things</c><00:14:36.780><c> going</c><00:14:36.930><c> for</c>

they've got a couple things going for

they've got a couple things going for
them<00:14:37.440><c> right</c><00:14:37.740><c> like</c><00:14:37.950><c> on</c><00:14:38.070><c> one</c><00:14:38.250><c> hand</c><00:14:38.280><c> I</c><00:14:38.790><c> think</c><00:14:38.910><c> they</c>

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:39.150 align:start position:0%
them right like on one hand I think they
 

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.590 align:start position:0%
them right like on one hand I think they
have<00:14:39.390><c> a</c><00:14:39.810><c> skilled</c><00:14:40.800><c> labor</c><00:14:41.070><c> force</c><00:14:41.300><c> right</c><00:14:42.300><c> that</c>

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
have a skilled labor force right that
 

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.980 align:start position:0%
have a skilled labor force right that
like<00:14:42.900><c> is</c><00:14:43.760><c> relatively</c><00:14:44.760><c> expensive</c><00:14:45.150><c> right</c><00:14:45.750><c> so</c><00:14:45.960><c> I</c>

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:45.990 align:start position:0%
like is relatively expensive right so I
 

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.500 align:start position:0%
like is relatively expensive right so I
think<00:14:46.050><c> that</c><00:14:46.320><c> they</c><00:14:46.560><c> are</c><00:14:46.680><c> seeking</c><00:14:46.980><c> and</c><00:14:47.550><c> excited</c>

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:48.510 align:start position:0%
think that they are seeking and excited
 

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
think that they are seeking and excited
about<00:14:48.660><c> AI</c><00:14:48.900><c> in</c><00:14:49.320><c> large</c><00:14:49.560><c> part</c><00:14:49.770><c> because</c><00:14:49.830><c> it's</c><00:14:50.070><c> the</c>

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.130 align:start position:0%
about AI in large part because it's the
 

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.500 align:start position:0%
about AI in large part because it's the

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.830 align:start position:0%

that have offered like labor for like
 

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.290 align:start position:0%

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
much lower cost right right so like
 

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.030 align:start position:0%
much lower cost right right so like

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that that's that's good
 

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that that's that's good
for<00:15:02.220><c> them</c><00:15:02.310><c> I</c><00:15:02.520><c> think</c><00:15:02.730><c> the</c><00:15:02.970><c> other</c><00:15:03.060><c> thing</c><00:15:03.270><c> that's</c>

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
for them I think the other thing that's
 

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
for them I think the other thing that's
also<00:15:03.600><c> encouraging</c><00:15:04.020><c> a</c><00:15:04.080><c> lot</c><00:15:04.170><c> of</c><00:15:04.290><c> experiments</c><00:15:04.740><c> is</c>

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
also encouraging a lot of experiments is
 

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.500 align:start position:0%
also encouraging a lot of experiments is
that<00:15:04.830><c> they</c><00:15:05.040><c> have</c><00:15:05.310><c> a</c><00:15:05.340><c> lot</c><00:15:05.610><c> more</c><00:15:05.640><c> coordination</c>

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.510 align:start position:0%
that they have a lot more coordination
 

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.660 align:start position:0%
that they have a lot more coordination
between<00:15:07.020><c> government</c><00:15:07.890><c> industry</c><00:15:08.160><c> and</c><00:15:08.400><c> labor</c>

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:08.670 align:start position:0%
between government industry and labor
 

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:10.430 align:start position:0%

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
which is making it more possible to
 

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.020 align:start position:0%
which is making it more possible to

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.030 align:start position:0%
experiment with these sorts of things so
 

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.700 align:start position:0%
experiment with these sorts of things so
I<00:15:12.240><c> think</c><00:15:12.420><c> in</c><00:15:12.660><c> a</c><00:15:12.960><c> really</c><00:15:12.990><c> interesting</c><00:15:13.530><c> case</c>

it probably wouldn't work right but like

it probably wouldn't work right but like

think now that understanding is just

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.010 align:start position:0%

guess it's we never got to assess what
mmm<00:17:43.640><c> and</c><00:17:43.820><c> so</c><00:17:44.090><c> do</c><00:17:44.240><c> you</c><00:17:44.330><c> see</c><00:17:44.540><c> companies</c><00:17:44.870><c> and</c><00:17:45.320><c> in</c>

obviously massively hyped but there's
 

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.150 align:start position:0%

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
also some reality behind it has there
 

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.770 align:start position:0%
also some reality behind it has there
been<00:17:55.190><c> a</c><00:17:55.310><c> negative</c><00:17:55.670><c> reaction</c><00:17:55.820><c> I</c><00:17:56.240><c> wouldn't</c><00:17:56.600><c> say</c>

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:56.780 align:start position:0%
been a negative reaction I wouldn't say
 

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.390 align:start position:0%
been a negative reaction I wouldn't say
so<00:17:56.810><c> I</c><00:17:57.050><c> mean</c><00:17:57.350><c> I</c><00:17:57.470><c> think</c><00:17:57.500><c> by</c><00:17:57.800><c> and</c><00:17:57.950><c> large</c><00:17:58.070><c> what</c>

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
so I mean I think by and large what
 

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.380 align:start position:0%
so I mean I think by and large what
we're<00:17:58.550><c> seeing</c><00:17:58.760><c> is</c><00:17:58.970><c> that</c><00:17:59.000><c> a</c><00:17:59.150><c> lot</c><00:17:59.360><c> of</c>

00:17:59.380 --> 00:17:59.390 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is that a lot of
 

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.150 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is that a lot of
governments<00:17:59.810><c> are</c><00:17:59.900><c> just</c><00:18:00.050><c> really</c><00:18:00.200><c> curious</c><00:18:00.590><c> they</c>

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
governments are just really curious they
 

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.380 align:start position:0%
governments are just really curious they
actually<00:18:01.430><c> want</c><00:18:01.580><c> a</c><00:18:01.610><c> better</c><00:18:01.790><c> understanding</c><00:18:02.300><c> of</c>

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:02.390 align:start position:0%
actually want a better understanding of
 

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
actually want a better understanding of
what's<00:18:02.630><c> going</c><00:18:02.810><c> on</c><00:18:03.020><c> okay</c><00:18:03.650><c> so</c><00:18:03.860><c> in</c><00:18:04.010><c> many</c><00:18:04.700><c> cases</c><00:18:05.210><c> I</c>

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:05.330 align:start position:0%
what's going on okay so in many cases I
 

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.700 align:start position:0%
what's going on okay so in many cases I
think<00:18:05.360><c> what</c><00:18:05.660><c> we're</c><00:18:05.780><c> seeing</c><00:18:05.990><c> is</c><00:18:06.260><c> like</c><00:18:06.290><c> people</c>

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:06.710 align:start position:0%
think what we're seeing is like people
 

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.830 align:start position:0%
think what we're seeing is like people
asking<00:18:07.250><c> you</c><00:18:07.880><c> know</c><00:18:08.000><c> like</c><00:18:08.210><c> what</c><00:18:08.390><c> is</c><00:18:08.510><c> happening</c>

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:10.910 align:start position:0%
in the technology okay so I think you
 

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
in the technology okay so I think you
know<00:18:11.000><c> the</c><00:18:11.150><c> phase</c><00:18:11.360><c> of</c><00:18:11.630><c> what</c><00:18:11.960><c> to</c><00:18:12.050><c> do</c><00:18:12.200><c> about</c><00:18:12.320><c> it</c><00:18:12.500><c> is</c>

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:12.650 align:start position:0%
know the phase of what to do about it is
 

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
know the phase of what to do about it is
still<00:18:13.190><c> on</c><00:18:13.610><c> this</c><00:18:13.850><c> way</c><00:18:14.090><c> right</c><00:18:14.960><c> so</c><00:18:15.230><c> that</c><00:18:15.380><c> you</c><00:18:15.560><c> like</c>

give them you know the PowerPoint deck
 

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.210 align:start position:0%
give them you know the PowerPoint deck
and<00:18:17.570><c> they're</c><00:18:18.020><c> like</c><00:18:18.140><c> okay</c><00:18:18.650><c> I</c><00:18:18.680><c> kind</c><00:18:18.860><c> of</c><00:18:18.980><c> get</c><00:18:19.070><c> how</c>

this works and then they go home you
 

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
this works and then they go home you
know<00:18:21.470><c> whatever</c><00:18:21.770><c> to</c><00:18:22.130><c> like</c><00:18:22.280><c> Japan</c><00:18:22.640><c> and</c><00:18:22.670><c> they're</c>

know whatever to like Japan and they're
 

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.090 align:start position:0%
know whatever to like Japan and they're
like<00:18:23.150><c> okay</c><00:18:23.480><c> no</c><00:18:24.020><c> you</c><00:18:24.110><c> think</c><00:18:24.230><c> about</c><00:18:24.410><c> it</c><00:18:24.560><c> yeah</c><00:18:25.070><c> I</c>

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:25.100 align:start position:0%
like okay no you think about it yeah I
 

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
like okay no you think about it yeah I
think<00:18:25.280><c> so</c><00:18:25.610><c> I</c><00:18:25.640><c> mean</c><00:18:25.850><c> this</c><00:18:25.940><c> is</c><00:18:26.000><c> how</c><00:18:26.180><c> government</c>

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:26.330 align:start position:0%
think so I mean this is how government
 

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
think so I mean this is how government
progresses<00:18:27.080><c> right</c><00:18:27.470><c> is</c><00:18:27.680><c> like</c><00:18:27.830><c> I</c><00:18:27.890><c> think</c><00:18:28.130><c> like</c>

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:28.250 align:start position:0%
progresses right is like I think like
 

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.530 align:start position:0%
progresses right is like I think like
they<00:18:28.400><c> ask</c><00:18:28.580><c> questions</c><00:18:28.790><c> to</c><00:18:29.240><c> get</c><00:18:29.360><c> information</c>

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:29.540 align:start position:0%
they ask questions to get information
 

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
they ask questions to get information
and<00:18:29.990><c> there's</c><00:18:30.290><c> like</c><00:18:30.410><c> a</c><00:18:30.440><c> long</c><00:18:30.740><c> process</c><00:18:31.010><c> of</c>

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:31.250 align:start position:0%
and there's like a long process of
 

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
and there's like a long process of
figuring<00:18:31.370><c> out</c><00:18:31.580><c> what</c><00:18:31.790><c> you</c><00:18:31.880><c> do</c><00:18:32.060><c> around</c><00:18:32.420><c> it</c><00:18:32.630><c> right</c>

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.050 align:start position:0%
figuring out what you do around it right
 

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.870 align:start position:0%
figuring out what you do around it right
but<00:18:33.500><c> I</c><00:18:33.530><c> mean</c><00:18:33.710><c> I</c><00:18:33.830><c> that</c><00:18:34.190><c> isn't</c><00:18:34.460><c> to</c><00:18:34.520><c> say</c><00:18:34.550><c> like</c>

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%

at<00:19:51.110><c> least</c><00:19:51.260><c> have</c><00:19:51.440><c> it</c><00:19:51.620><c> in</c><00:19:51.770><c> the</c><00:19:51.980><c> we</c><00:19:52.730><c> Louise</c><00:19:53.000><c> had</c><00:19:53.180><c> in</c>

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:53.300 align:start position:0%
at least have it in the we Louise had in
 

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
at least have it in the we Louise had in
the<00:19:53.420><c> you</c>

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:53.810 align:start position:0%
the you
 

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.350 align:start position:0%
the you
best<00:19:53.930><c> case</c><00:19:54.200><c> right</c><00:19:55.010><c> was</c><00:19:55.250><c> basically</c><00:19:55.640><c> a</c><00:19:55.790><c> report</c>

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
best case right was basically a report
 

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.300 align:start position:0%
best case right was basically a report
that<00:19:56.540><c> like</c><00:19:56.720><c> really</c><00:19:56.990><c> focused</c><00:19:57.350><c> in</c><00:19:57.470><c> on</c><00:19:57.650><c> like</c><00:19:57.890><c> okay</c>

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
that like really focused in on like okay
 

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.090 align:start position:0%
that like really focused in on like okay
what<00:19:59.120><c> are</c><00:19:59.330><c> the</c><00:19:59.630><c> real</c><00:19:59.810><c> concrete</c><00:20:00.080><c> risks</c><00:20:00.740><c> here</c>

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:01.100 align:start position:0%
what are the real concrete risks here
 

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.410 align:start position:0%
what are the real concrete risks here
yeah<00:20:01.250><c> and</c><00:20:01.460><c> part</c><00:20:01.670><c> of</c><00:20:01.730><c> the</c><00:20:01.820><c> idea</c><00:20:01.850><c> was</c><00:20:02.060><c> to</c><00:20:02.240><c> pivot</c>

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:02.420 align:start position:0%
yeah and part of the idea was to pivot
 

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.850 align:start position:0%
yeah and part of the idea was to pivot
away<00:20:02.600><c> from</c><00:20:02.900><c> discussions</c><00:20:03.230><c> that</c><00:20:03.560><c> were</c><00:20:03.680><c> just</c>

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.090 align:start position:0%
like okay the main thing we've got to
 

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
like okay the main thing we've got to
talk<00:20:05.270><c> about</c><00:20:05.540><c> here</c><00:20:05.780><c> is</c><00:20:05.900><c> whether</c><00:20:06.350><c> or</c><00:20:06.500><c> not</c><00:20:06.590><c> robots</c>

are going to destroy us right like I
 

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.540 align:start position:0%
are going to destroy us right like I

is like kind of an interesting scenario
to<00:20:12.440><c> consider</c><00:20:12.770><c> but</c><00:20:13.040><c> like</c><00:20:13.190><c> you</c><00:20:13.700><c> write</c><00:20:13.940><c> like</c>

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:14.180 align:start position:0%
to consider but like you write like

there's a lot of like core near-term
 

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.310 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of like core near-term
problems<00:20:17.090><c> that</c><00:20:17.240><c> need</c><00:20:17.360><c> to</c><00:20:17.480><c> be</c><00:20:17.510><c> dealt</c><00:20:17.750><c> with</c><00:20:17.840><c> and</c>

problems that need to be dealt with and
 

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.690 align:start position:0%
problems that need to be dealt with and
I<00:20:18.500><c> mean</c><00:20:18.620><c> I</c><00:20:18.680><c> was</c><00:20:18.800><c> one</c><00:20:18.980><c> thing</c><00:20:19.100><c> they</c><00:20:19.220><c> did</c><00:20:19.430><c> that</c><00:20:19.610><c> was</c>

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:19.700 align:start position:0%
I mean I was one thing they did that was
 

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.290 align:start position:0%
I mean I was one thing they did that was
very<00:20:19.850><c> useful</c>

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:20.300 align:start position:0%
very useful
 

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
very useful
so<00:20:20.810><c> what</c><00:20:21.350><c> aside</c><00:20:21.980><c> from</c><00:20:22.130><c> the</c><00:20:22.220><c> stuff</c><00:20:22.400><c> we</c><00:20:22.520><c> talked</c>

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:22.730 align:start position:0%
so what aside from the stuff we talked
 

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.460 align:start position:0%
so what aside from the stuff we talked
about<00:20:22.820><c> where</c><00:20:23.480><c> what</c><00:20:23.840><c> do</c><00:20:23.900><c> you</c><00:20:23.960><c> find</c><00:20:24.170><c> to</c><00:20:24.350><c> be</c>

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:24.470 align:start position:0%
about where what do you find to be
 

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.860 align:start position:0%
about where what do you find to be
particularly<00:20:25.010><c> exciting</c><00:20:25.700><c> both</c><00:20:26.030><c> like</c><00:20:26.300><c> here</c>

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:26.870 align:start position:0%
particularly exciting both like here
 

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.650 align:start position:0%
particularly exciting both like here
like<00:20:27.110><c> at</c><00:20:27.410><c> a</c><00:20:27.470><c> you</c><00:20:27.800><c> know</c><00:20:27.920><c> local</c><00:20:28.520><c> Bay</c><00:20:29.000><c> Area</c><00:20:29.300><c> level</c>

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:29.660 align:start position:0%
like at a you know local Bay Area level
 

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
like at a you know local Bay Area level
as<00:20:30.200><c> far</c><00:20:30.410><c> as</c><00:20:30.500><c> like</c><00:20:30.650><c> research</c><00:20:30.950><c> and</c><00:20:31.160><c> then</c><00:20:31.640><c> at</c><00:20:31.940><c> you</c>

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.330 align:start position:0%
as far as like research and then at you
 

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.030 align:start position:0%
as far as like research and then at you
know<00:20:32.420><c> global</c><00:20:32.870><c> international</c><00:20:33.230><c> research</c><00:20:33.830><c> level</c>

moving<00:20:34.430><c> the</c><00:20:34.640><c> stuff</c><00:20:34.820><c> forward</c><00:20:35.060><c> yeah</c><00:20:35.630><c> so</c><00:20:36.260><c> I</c><00:20:36.290><c> think</c>

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:36.500 align:start position:0%
moving the stuff forward yeah so I think
 

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.900 align:start position:0%
moving the stuff forward yeah so I think
there's<00:20:36.740><c> two</c><00:20:37.100><c> things</c><00:20:37.310><c> that</c><00:20:37.460><c> I</c><00:20:37.550><c> find</c><00:20:37.700><c> really</c>

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:37.910 align:start position:0%
there's two things that I find really
 

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:39.820 align:start position:0%
there's two things that I find really
interesting<00:20:38.000><c> right</c><00:20:38.480><c> now</c><00:20:38.510><c> one</c><00:20:38.840><c> of</c><00:20:38.870><c> them</c><00:20:39.080><c> is</c><00:20:39.440><c> the</c>

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:39.830 align:start position:0%
interesting right now one of them is the
 

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.260 align:start position:0%
interesting right now one of them is the

right so like largely visited technology
 

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
right so like largely visited technology
we've<00:20:43.550><c> been</c><00:20:43.670><c> using</c><00:20:43.850><c> to</c><00:20:44.180><c> solve</c><00:20:44.390><c> like</c><00:20:44.660><c> pretty</c>

we've been using to solve like pretty
 

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.930 align:start position:0%
we've been using to solve like pretty
pragmatic<00:20:45.560><c> things</c><00:20:45.830><c> right</c><00:20:46.220><c> which</c><00:20:46.370><c> is</c><00:20:46.520><c> like</c><00:20:46.730><c> how</c>

pragmatic things right which is like how
 

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.970 align:start position:0%
pragmatic things right which is like how
do<00:20:47.000><c> we</c><00:20:47.270><c> ensure</c><00:20:48.110><c> that</c><00:20:48.140><c> we</c><00:20:48.350><c> can</c><00:20:48.530><c> adequately</c>

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:48.980 align:start position:0%
do we ensure that we can adequately
 

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:52.330 align:start position:0%
do we ensure that we can adequately

yeah<00:22:09.400><c> no</c><00:22:09.700><c> man</c><00:22:10.510><c> like</c><00:22:10.900><c> the</c><00:22:11.020><c> fidelity</c><00:22:11.320><c> of</c><00:22:11.500><c> it</c><00:22:11.680><c> is</c>

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:11.830 align:start position:0%
yeah no man like the fidelity of it is
 

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
yeah no man like the fidelity of it is
shocking<00:22:12.250><c> yeah</c><00:22:12.580><c> that's</c><00:22:12.910><c> been</c><00:22:13.150><c> like</c><00:22:13.300><c> one</c><00:22:13.630><c> year</c>

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:13.870 align:start position:0%
shocking yeah that's been like one year
 

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.450 align:start position:0%
shocking yeah that's been like one year
right<00:22:14.170><c> right</c><00:22:14.530><c> and</c><00:22:14.710><c> so</c><00:22:14.830><c> it's</c><00:22:14.920><c> gotten</c><00:22:15.130><c> like</c><00:22:15.250><c> way</c>

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:15.460 align:start position:0%
right right and so it's gotten like way
 

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.950 align:start position:0%
right right and so it's gotten like way
better<00:22:15.640><c> which</c><00:22:15.970><c> letting</c><00:22:16.180><c> a</c><00:22:16.240><c> super</c><00:22:16.510><c> interesting</c>

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
better which letting a super interesting
 

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.170 align:start position:0%
better which letting a super interesting
I<00:22:17.890><c> think</c><00:22:18.160><c> the</c><00:22:18.309><c> other</c><00:22:18.430><c> thing</c><00:22:18.670><c> is</c><00:22:18.790><c> also</c><00:22:18.940><c> like</c>

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:19.180 align:start position:0%
I think the other thing is also like
 

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
I think the other thing is also like
trying<00:22:19.390><c> to</c><00:22:19.420><c> figure</c><00:22:19.600><c> out</c><00:22:19.809><c> like</c><00:22:19.920><c> Disney's</c><00:22:20.920><c> like</c>

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.070 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out like Disney's like
 

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.830 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out like Disney's like
really<00:22:21.309><c> unexpected</c><00:22:21.940><c> things</c><00:22:22.120><c> that</c><00:22:22.300><c> emerge</c><00:22:22.540><c> too</c>

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
really unexpected things that emerge too
 

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.270 align:start position:0%
really unexpected things that emerge too
so<00:22:23.140><c> the</c><00:22:23.320><c> other</c><00:22:23.440><c> thing</c><00:22:23.710><c> that's</c><00:22:23.800><c> I</c><00:22:23.920><c> think</c><00:22:24.100><c> is</c>

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
so the other thing that's I think is
 

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
so the other thing that's I think is
really<00:22:24.490><c> cool</c><00:22:24.640><c> right</c><00:22:24.790><c> now</c><00:22:24.850><c> is</c><00:22:25.059><c> this</c><00:22:25.150><c> a</c><00:22:25.210><c> paper</c>

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:25.450 align:start position:0%
really cool right now is this a paper
 

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
really cool right now is this a paper
that<00:22:25.660><c> came</c><00:22:25.780><c> out</c><00:22:25.990><c> from</c><00:22:26.170><c> deep</c><00:22:26.440><c> mind</c><00:22:26.710><c> I</c><00:22:27.010><c> think</c>

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.070 align:start position:0%
that came out from deep mind I think
 

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
that came out from deep mind I think
earlier<00:22:27.490><c> this</c><00:22:27.640><c> year</c><00:22:27.700><c> that</c><00:22:28.510><c> was</c><00:22:28.630><c> kind</c><00:22:28.840><c> of</c><00:22:28.930><c> like</c>

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.050 align:start position:0%
earlier this year that was kind of like
 

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.630 align:start position:0%
earlier this year that was kind of like
if<00:22:29.260><c> you</c><00:22:29.350><c> get</c><00:22:29.470><c> two</c><00:22:29.680><c> machines</c><00:22:30.040><c> to</c><00:22:30.190><c> talk</c><00:22:30.370><c> to</c><00:22:30.520><c> one</c>

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
if you get two machines to talk to one
 

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.250 align:start position:0%
if you get two machines to talk to one
another<00:22:30.670><c> they</c><00:22:31.120><c> will</c><00:22:31.210><c> eventually</c><00:22:31.600><c> let</c><00:22:32.020><c> and</c><00:22:32.230><c> you</c>

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:32.260 align:start position:0%
another they will eventually let and you
 

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.690 align:start position:0%
another they will eventually let and you
can<00:22:32.440><c> set</c><00:22:32.620><c> up</c><00:22:32.650><c> another</c><00:22:32.890><c> computer</c><00:22:33.309><c> to</c><00:22:33.340><c> basically</c>

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:33.700 align:start position:0%
can set up another computer to basically
 

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
can set up another computer to basically
say<00:22:33.820><c> like</c><00:22:33.970><c> oh</c><00:22:34.059><c> I</c><00:22:34.120><c> can</c><00:22:34.360><c> read</c><00:22:34.540><c> what</c><00:22:34.780><c> you're</c>

00:22:36.309 --> 00:22:37.890 align:start position:0%
saying I can't read what you're saying
you<00:22:36.820><c> can</c><00:22:36.970><c> basically</c><00:22:37.090><c> train</c><00:22:37.540><c> these</c><00:22:37.690><c> two</c>

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:37.900 align:start position:0%
you can basically train these two
 

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
you can basically train these two

learn how to accomplish that task and
 

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.590 align:start position:0%

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's not like very good encryption but

it's not like very good encryption but

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:38.290 align:start position:0%
learning is such a powerful tool and
 

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.830 align:start position:0%
learning is such a powerful tool and

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
also cognitively it works in a way

oh man that's fascinating I mean it's
 

00:24:32.679 --> 00:24:34.469 align:start position:0%
oh man that's fascinating I mean it's
already<00:24:32.859><c> kind</c><00:24:33.369><c> of</c><00:24:33.489><c> gone</c><00:24:33.700><c> that</c><00:24:33.970><c> way</c><00:24:34.119><c> and</c><00:24:34.299><c> that</c>

already kind of gone that way and that
 

00:24:34.479 --> 00:24:36.629 align:start position:0%
already kind of gone that way and that

00:24:36.629 --> 00:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
like many CS programs are so technical
 

00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:38.339 align:start position:0%
like many CS programs are so technical
you<00:24:36.789><c> actually</c><00:24:37.149><c> never</c><00:24:37.419><c> build</c><00:24:37.659><c> a</c><00:24:37.749><c> web</c><00:24:37.899><c> app</c><00:24:38.049><c> well</c>

00:24:38.339 --> 00:24:38.349 align:start position:0%
you actually never build a web app well
 

00:24:38.349 --> 00:24:39.389 align:start position:0%
you actually never build a web app well
yeah<00:24:38.470><c> that's</c><00:24:38.649><c> right</c><00:24:38.769><c> you</c><00:24:38.950><c> can</c><00:24:39.099><c> go</c><00:24:39.220><c> through</c>

00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right you can go through
 

00:24:39.399 --> 00:24:41.009 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right you can go through
sand<00:24:39.609><c> routes</c><00:24:39.759><c> yes</c><00:24:39.970><c> and</c><00:24:40.179><c> never</c><00:24:40.359><c> build</c><00:24:40.570><c> and</c><00:24:40.960><c> I</c>

00:24:41.009 --> 00:24:41.019 align:start position:0%
sand routes yes and never build and I
 

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:42.450 align:start position:0%
sand routes yes and never build and I
think<00:24:41.049><c> it's</c><00:24:41.259><c> a</c><00:24:41.320><c> very</c><00:24:41.470><c> natural</c><00:24:41.679><c> trend</c><00:24:42.249><c> that</c>

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:42.460 align:start position:0%
think it's a very natural trend that
 

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
think it's a very natural trend that
like<00:24:42.669><c> you</c><00:24:42.820><c> know</c><00:24:42.940><c> we're</c><00:24:43.269><c> getting</c><00:24:43.359><c> to</c><00:24:43.570><c> higher</c>

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:43.929 align:start position:0%
like you know we're getting to higher
 

00:24:43.929 --> 00:24:45.749 align:start position:0%
like you know we're getting to higher
and<00:24:44.049><c> higher</c><00:24:44.109><c> levels</c><00:24:44.259><c> of</c><00:24:44.679><c> distraction</c><00:24:44.950><c> yeah</c><00:24:45.609><c> so</c>

00:24:45.749 --> 00:24:45.759 align:start position:0%
and higher levels of distraction yeah so
 

00:24:45.759 --> 00:24:46.950 align:start position:0%
and higher levels of distraction yeah so
like<00:24:45.909><c> in</c><00:24:46.029><c> some</c><00:24:46.179><c> ways</c><00:24:46.210><c> machine</c><00:24:46.599><c> learning</c><00:24:46.869><c> is</c>

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
like in some ways machine learning is
 

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.509 align:start position:0%
like in some ways machine learning is
like<00:24:47.229><c> ultimate</c><00:24:47.649><c> level</c><00:24:47.799><c> abstraction</c><00:24:48.399><c> where</c>

00:24:48.509 --> 00:24:48.519 align:start position:0%
like ultimate level abstraction where
 

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:49.769 align:start position:0%
like ultimate level abstraction where
it's<00:24:48.609><c> like</c><00:24:48.729><c> even</c><00:24:48.999><c> if</c><00:24:49.119><c> you</c><00:24:49.210><c> wanted</c><00:24:49.720><c> to</c>

00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:49.779 align:start position:0%
it's like even if you wanted to
 

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
it's like even if you wanted to

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:54.369 align:start position:0%
like kind of difficult to do so right
 

00:24:54.369 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
like kind of difficult to do so right

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:56.830 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I guess so but I I see it
 

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.649 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I guess so but I I see it
becoming<00:24:57.249><c> like</c><00:24:57.460><c> there's</c><00:24:57.940><c> just</c><00:24:58.149><c> new</c><00:24:58.330><c> ways</c><00:24:58.479><c> of</c>

00:24:58.649 --> 00:24:58.659 align:start position:0%

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:01.570 align:start position:0%
programming right like how you structure
 

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.359 align:start position:0%

00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:05.249 align:start position:0%
the code because at a certain point
things<00:25:03.729><c> will</c><00:25:03.909><c> just</c><00:25:04.090><c> become</c><00:25:04.359><c> abstracted</c><00:25:05.109><c> and</c>

00:25:05.249 --> 00:25:05.259 align:start position:0%
things will just become abstracted and
 

00:25:05.259 --> 00:25:06.839 align:start position:0%
things will just become abstracted and

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:06.849 align:start position:0%
you won't have to do it anymore yeah
 

00:25:06.849 --> 00:25:08.249 align:start position:0%
you won't have to do it anymore yeah
like<00:25:07.029><c> I</c><00:25:07.119><c> think</c><00:25:07.149><c> about</c><00:25:07.509><c> it</c><00:25:07.599><c> in</c><00:25:07.720><c> the</c><00:25:07.809><c> context</c><00:25:08.169><c> of</c>

like I think about it in the context of
 

00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:09.869 align:start position:0%
like I think about it in the context of

like you know parsed creating an API
 

00:25:09.879 --> 00:25:12.029 align:start position:0%
like you know parsed creating an API

00:25:12.039 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
right like that will exist for many

00:25:59.940 --> 00:25:59.950 align:start position:0%
going to build business around AI so
 

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.099 align:start position:0%
going to build business around AI so
just<00:26:00.519><c> for</c><00:26:00.700><c> like</c><00:26:00.820><c> we</c><00:26:01.419><c> can</c><00:26:01.539><c> start</c><00:26:01.690><c> broad</c><00:26:01.929><c> and</c>

00:26:02.099 --> 00:26:02.109 align:start position:0%
just for like we can start broad and
 

00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:04.950 align:start position:0%
just for like we can start broad and
then<00:26:02.229><c> go</c><00:26:02.349><c> more</c><00:26:02.619><c> narrow</c><00:26:02.859><c> do</c><00:26:03.639><c> you</c><00:26:03.759><c> think</c><00:26:04.059><c> AI</c><00:26:04.419><c> will</c>

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
then go more narrow do you think AI will
 

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
then go more narrow do you think AI will

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%

of this is just entirely reliant on the

and so to a certain extent like folks
 

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.650 align:start position:0%
and so to a certain extent like folks
can<00:27:41.380><c> almost</c><00:27:41.530><c> guess</c><00:27:42.040><c> which</c><00:27:42.790><c> techniques</c><00:27:43.480><c> you're</c>

can almost guess which techniques you're
 

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
can almost guess which techniques you're

implementing which API you're using and
 

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.990 align:start position:0%
implementing which API you're using and

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
if they're faster with better engineers
 

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
if they're faster with better engineers
and<00:27:49.390><c> then</c><00:27:49.690><c> they</c><00:27:49.870><c> have</c><00:27:50.020><c> like</c><00:27:50.260><c> the</c><00:27:50.380><c> magic</c><00:27:50.500><c> touch</c>

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:50.830 align:start position:0%
and then they have like the magic touch
 

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.970 align:start position:0%
and then they have like the magic touch
of<00:27:51.070><c> like</c><00:27:51.250><c> the</c><00:27:51.520><c> product</c><00:27:52.060><c> person</c><00:27:52.260><c> I</c><00:27:53.260><c> don't</c><00:27:53.740><c> see</c>

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:53.980 align:start position:0%
of like the product person I don't see
 

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
of like the product person I don't see
any<00:27:54.130><c> reason</c><00:27:54.430><c> why</c><00:27:54.460><c> they</c><00:27:54.580><c> can't</c><00:27:54.700><c> just</c><00:27:55.000><c> jump</c>

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
any reason why they can't just jump

any reason why they can't just jump

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:55.590 align:start position:0%
like follow what seems to be like the
 

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.100 align:start position:0%
like follow what seems to be like the

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
you actually do this because what you
 

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.710 align:start position:0%
you actually do this because what you

00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:37.460 align:start position:0%
train on the device as well right
 

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.920 align:start position:0%

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:16.410 align:start position:0%
portray what a neural net is doing and
 

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:17.300 align:start position:0%

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:17.310 align:start position:0%
that stuff ends up being incredibly
 

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
that stuff ends up being incredibly

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.740 align:start position:0%

understand the technology and also be
 

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.810 align:start position:0%
understand the technology and also be

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.830 align:start position:0%
able to like to use it effectively and
so<00:37:23.970><c> I</c><00:37:24.000><c> think</c><00:37:24.060><c> that's</c><00:37:24.270><c> another</c><00:37:24.480><c> thing</c><00:37:24.660><c> that's</c>

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I think that's another thing that's
 

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
so I think that's another thing that's
