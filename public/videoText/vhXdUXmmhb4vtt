that<00:11:31.720><c> it's</c><00:11:31.839><c> getting</c><00:11:32.079><c> really</c><00:11:32.240><c> cool</c><00:11:32.720><c> yes</c><00:11:33.519><c> so</c><00:11:33.680><c> I</c>

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
that it's getting really cool yes so I
 

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.310 align:start position:0%
that it's getting really cool yes so I
think<00:11:33.920><c> what's</c><00:11:34.120><c> so</c><00:11:34.320><c> cool</c><00:11:34.560><c> is</c><00:11:34.720><c> like</c><00:11:34.920><c> not</c><00:11:35.079><c> only</c>

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
think what's so cool is like not only
 

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.230 align:start position:0%
think what's so cool is like not only
have<00:11:35.480><c> things</c><00:11:35.760><c> gotten</c><00:11:36.440><c> so</c><00:11:36.720><c> much</c><00:11:37.000><c> better</c><00:11:37.959><c> since</c>

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
have things gotten so much better since
 

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.990 align:start position:0%
have things gotten so much better since
the<00:11:38.560><c> 990s</c><00:11:39.560><c> things</c><00:11:39.760><c> are</c><00:11:40.680><c> getting</c><00:11:41.240><c> better</c><00:11:42.240><c> so</c><00:11:42.839><c> if</c>

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
the 990s things are getting better so if
 

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.990 align:start position:0%
the 990s things are getting better so if
all<00:11:43.160><c> of</c><00:11:43.279><c> this</c><00:11:43.440><c> stuff's</c><00:11:43.839><c> great</c><00:11:44.440><c> why</c><00:11:44.560><c> are</c><00:11:44.720><c> people</c>

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff's great why are people
 

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.509 align:start position:0%
all of this stuff's great why are people
so<00:11:45.240><c> pessimistic</c><00:11:46.240><c> well</c><00:11:46.440><c> I</c><00:11:46.560><c> think</c><00:11:47.040><c> it's</c><00:11:48.040><c> hard</c><00:11:48.320><c> to</c>

00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
so pessimistic well I think it's hard to
 

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:50.430 align:start position:0%
so pessimistic well I think it's hard to
have<00:11:48.760><c> perspective</c><00:11:49.279><c> man</c><00:11:49.839><c> yes</c><00:11:50.120><c> I</c><00:11:50.200><c> think</c><00:11:50.320><c> when</c>
