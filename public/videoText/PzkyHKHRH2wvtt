00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
at this new therapeutic area and so I
 

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
at this new therapeutic area and so I

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:36.210 align:start position:0%
think
 

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%

that<00:27:46.350><c> can</c><00:27:46.560><c> give</c><00:27:46.710><c> us</c><00:27:46.830><c> a</c><00:27:46.920><c> sense</c><00:27:47.160><c> for</c><00:27:47.370><c> whether</c><00:27:47.520><c> our</c>

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%

there's<00:27:50.820><c> a</c><00:27:50.880><c> lot</c><00:27:51.030><c> of</c><00:27:51.120><c> innovation</c><00:27:51.570><c> in</c><00:27:51.630><c> that</c>

basically inhibit gene expression that

you couldn't knock it out completely
 

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.090 align:start position:0%
you couldn't knock it out completely
okay<00:28:27.480><c> so</c><00:28:27.780><c> you</c><00:28:27.870><c> would</c><00:28:28.260><c> be</c><00:28:28.560><c> you</c><00:28:29.010><c> know</c>

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
okay so you would be you know
 

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.100 align:start position:0%
okay so you would be you know

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
but over generations no no it's just in
 

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.730 align:start position:0%
but over generations no no it's just in

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
real time so like but then a couple of

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:42.750 align:start position:0%
hours and it's only transient unless you
 

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.590 align:start position:0%

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
create least stable cell lines but so
 

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.150 align:start position:0%
create least stable cell lines but so
you<00:28:45.660><c> can</c><00:28:45.840><c> knock</c><00:28:46.020><c> it</c><00:28:46.050><c> down</c><00:28:46.200><c> transiently</c><00:28:46.920><c> and</c>

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
you can knock it down transiently and
 

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
you can knock it down transiently and
then<00:28:47.250><c> see</c><00:28:47.460><c> the</c><00:28:47.610><c> effect</c><00:28:47.970><c> but</c><00:28:48.630><c> it</c><00:28:48.870><c> was</c><00:28:49.110><c> so</c><00:28:49.410><c> era</c>

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:49.890 align:start position:0%
then see the effect but it was so era
 

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:51.410 align:start position:0%
then see the effect but it was so era

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.050 align:start position:0%
would knock down Jeannie's mission like
 

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
would knock down Jeannie's mission like

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:56.970 align:start position:0%
fifty but seeing you would be like what
 

00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
fifty but seeing you would be like what
does<00:28:57.030><c> it</c><00:28:57.210><c> really</c><00:28:57.360><c> mean</c><00:28:57.530><c> versus</c><00:28:58.530><c> if</c><00:28:58.770><c> you</c><00:28:58.890><c> knock</c>

00:28:59.240 --> 00:28:59.250 align:start position:0%
does it really mean versus if you knock
 

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
does it really mean versus if you knock
out<00:28:59.490><c> the</c><00:28:59.700><c> gene</c><00:28:59.730><c> and</c><00:29:00.120><c> it's</c><00:29:00.240><c> no</c><00:29:00.390><c> longer</c><00:29:00.690><c> there</c>

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:01.290 align:start position:0%
out the gene and it's no longer there
 

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
out the gene and it's no longer there
or<00:29:01.620><c> you</c><00:29:02.040><c> create</c><00:29:02.280><c> a</c><00:29:02.370><c> mutation</c><00:29:02.760><c> that</c><00:29:02.940><c> truncates</c>

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:03.570 align:start position:0%
or you create a mutation that truncates
 

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
or you create a mutation that truncates

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:05.130 align:start position:0%
the gene and it's no longer expressed
 

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%

then<00:29:05.790><c> you're</c><00:29:06.270><c> good</c><00:29:06.480><c> right</c><00:29:06.510><c> like</c><00:29:06.840><c> it's</c><00:29:07.020><c> gone</c><00:29:07.260><c> so</c>

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:07.650 align:start position:0%
then you're good right like it's gone so
 

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
then you're good right like it's gone so

basically<00:29:26.400><c> knock</c><00:29:26.640><c> out</c><00:29:26.850><c> every</c><00:29:27.300><c> single</c><00:29:27.510><c> gene</c>

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:27.930 align:start position:0%
basically knock out every single gene
 

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.350 align:start position:0%
basically knock out every single gene
and<00:29:28.440><c> for</c><00:29:29.160><c> the</c><00:29:29.220><c> first</c><00:29:29.400><c> time</c><00:29:29.640><c> you</c><00:29:29.880><c> can</c><00:29:30.030><c> do</c><00:29:30.180><c> that</c>

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
and for the first time you can do that
 

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.660 align:start position:0%
and for the first time you can do that
at<00:29:30.570><c> scale</c><00:29:30.840><c> and</c><00:29:31.110><c> understand</c><00:29:31.590><c> what</c><00:29:32.340><c> is</c><00:29:32.520><c> the</c>

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:32.670 align:start position:0%
at scale and understand what is the
 

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.820 align:start position:0%
at scale and understand what is the

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:34.830 align:start position:0%
function of every single gene right so
 

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.950 align:start position:0%
function of every single gene right so
it's<00:29:35.340><c> incredibly</c><00:29:35.820><c> powerful</c><00:29:36.030><c> so</c><00:29:36.600><c> where</c><00:29:36.780><c> do</c><00:29:36.870><c> you</c>

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly powerful so where do you
 

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.900 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly powerful so where do you
think<00:29:37.140><c> CRISPR</c><00:29:37.620><c> like</c><00:29:37.890><c> assuming</c><00:29:38.400><c> everything</c>

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:38.910 align:start position:0%
think CRISPR like assuming everything
 

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
think CRISPR like assuming everything
you<00:29:39.030><c> know</c><00:29:39.150><c> it</c><00:29:39.240><c> gets</c><00:29:39.360><c> tested</c><00:29:39.660><c> it</c><00:29:39.900><c> goes</c><00:29:39.990><c> all</c><00:29:40.140><c> the</c>

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:40.170 align:start position:0%
you know it gets tested it goes all the
 

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.110 align:start position:0%
you know it gets tested it goes all the

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
way through where will it start to see
 

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.100 align:start position:0%
way through where will it start to see
traction<00:29:42.750><c> first</c><00:29:43.730><c> so</c><00:29:44.730><c> it</c><00:29:45.030><c> mean</c><00:29:45.270><c> it's</c><00:29:45.420><c> already</c><00:29:45.840><c> I</c>

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:46.110 align:start position:0%
traction first so it mean it's already I
 

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.500 align:start position:0%
traction first so it mean it's already I
think<00:29:46.170><c> there's</c><00:29:46.620><c> some</c><00:29:46.800><c> really</c><00:29:46.980><c> interesting</c>

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:47.510 align:start position:0%
think there's some really interesting
 

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
think there's some really interesting
applications<00:29:48.510><c> that</c><00:29:48.630><c> people</c><00:29:48.900><c> are</c><00:29:48.960><c> looking</c><00:29:49.230><c> at</c>

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:49.410 align:start position:0%
applications that people are looking at
 

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.100 align:start position:0%
applications that people are looking at
obviously<00:29:49.980><c> the</c><00:29:50.550><c> most</c><00:29:50.760><c> the</c><00:29:51.660><c> most</c><00:29:51.780><c> obvious</c>

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:52.110 align:start position:0%
obviously the most the most obvious
 

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.530 align:start position:0%
obviously the most the most obvious
application<00:29:52.230><c> is</c><00:29:52.830><c> to</c><00:29:52.980><c> edit</c><00:29:53.370><c> genetic</c><00:29:54.120><c> defects</c>

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
application is to edit genetic defects
 

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.510 align:start position:0%
application is to edit genetic defects
so<00:29:54.930><c> if</c><00:29:55.140><c> there's</c><00:29:55.350><c> like</c><00:29:55.650><c> a</c><00:29:55.680><c> lethal</c><00:29:56.160><c> genetic</c>

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
so if there's like a lethal genetic
 

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.270 align:start position:0%
so if there's like a lethal genetic
defect<00:29:57.000><c> being</c><00:29:57.300><c> able</c><00:29:57.390><c> to</c><00:29:57.540><c> create</c><00:29:57.960><c> that</c><00:29:58.280><c> so</c>

00:29:59.270 --> 00:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
defect being able to create that so
 

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
defect being able to create that so
definitely<00:29:59.760><c> there's</c><00:29:59.940><c> a</c><00:30:00.000><c> lot</c><00:30:00.150><c> of</c><00:30:00.240><c> innovation</c>

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:00.570 align:start position:0%
definitely there's a lot of innovation
 

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.770 align:start position:0%
definitely there's a lot of innovation
in<00:30:00.810><c> that</c><00:30:00.930><c> space</c><00:30:02.120><c> actually</c><00:30:03.120><c> there</c><00:30:03.390><c> was</c><00:30:03.510><c> just</c><00:30:03.690><c> a</c>

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
in that space actually there was just a
 

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.020 align:start position:0%
in that space actually there was just a
recent<00:30:03.960><c> application</c><00:30:04.590><c> of</c><00:30:04.710><c> it</c><00:30:04.830><c> for</c><00:30:05.070><c> RNA</c><00:30:05.580><c> like</c>

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:06.030 align:start position:0%
recent application of it for RNA like
 

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.820 align:start position:0%
recent application of it for RNA like
editing<00:30:06.480><c> so</c><00:30:06.780><c> that's</c><00:30:06.960><c> the</c><00:30:07.140><c> expression</c><00:30:07.650><c> of</c><00:30:07.740><c> the</c>

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:07.830 align:start position:0%
editing so that's the expression of the
 

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.260 align:start position:0%
editing so that's the expression of the
genes<00:30:08.070><c> so</c><00:30:08.220><c> rather</c><00:30:08.370><c> than</c><00:30:08.550><c> editing</c><00:30:08.940><c> the</c><00:30:09.060><c> gene</c>

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:09.270 align:start position:0%
genes so rather than editing the gene
 

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.900 align:start position:0%
genes so rather than editing the gene
itself<00:30:09.740><c> editing</c><00:30:10.740><c> the</c><00:30:11.070><c> expression</c><00:30:11.640><c> of</c><00:30:11.790><c> the</c>

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:11.910 align:start position:0%

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.580 align:start position:0%

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:13.590 align:start position:0%
gene kind of transiently
 

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.190 align:start position:0%
gene kind of transiently
okay<00:30:14.100><c> which</c><00:30:14.610><c> is</c><00:30:14.760><c> pretty</c><00:30:14.970><c> interesting</c><00:30:15.270><c> so</c><00:30:15.960><c> I</c>

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay which is pretty interesting so I
 

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay which is pretty interesting so I
think<00:30:16.320><c> there</c><00:30:16.890><c> you'll</c><00:30:17.070><c> see</c><00:30:17.280><c> less</c><00:30:17.460><c> of</c><00:30:17.730><c> a</c>

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:17.850 align:start position:0%
think there you'll see less of a
 

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.430 align:start position:0%
think there you'll see less of a

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%

right<00:30:27.090><c> well</c><00:30:27.360><c> then</c><00:30:27.510><c> I</c><00:30:27.690><c> guess</c><00:30:28.440><c> I</c><00:30:28.560><c> have</c><00:30:28.590><c> one</c><00:30:28.680><c> more</c>

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:28.920 align:start position:0%

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:16.990 align:start position:0%
telomere length it's like an endpoint
 

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:18.990 align:start position:0%

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:21.549 align:start position:0%
established so you actually you know see
 

00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:23.490 align:start position:0%

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:23.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of noise and that particular
 

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
a lot of noise and that particular
endpoint<00:32:24.240><c> and</c><00:32:25.240><c> so</c><00:32:25.660><c> it's</c><00:32:26.320><c> hard</c><00:32:26.530><c> to</c><00:32:26.679><c> know</c><00:32:26.830><c> if</c><00:32:26.860><c> you</c>

00:32:27.299 --> 00:32:27.309 align:start position:0%

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:19.660 align:start position:0%
just in general for me when I do it I
 

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
just in general for me when I do it I
feel<00:37:19.690><c> like</c><00:37:20.760><c> my</c><00:37:21.760><c> appetite</c><00:37:22.210><c> control</c><00:37:22.540><c> is</c><00:37:22.660><c> a</c><00:37:22.690><c> lot</c>

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:22.810 align:start position:0%
feel like my appetite control is a lot
 

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:24.750 align:start position:0%
feel like my appetite control is a lot
better<00:37:22.960><c> and</c><00:37:23.320><c> it</c><00:37:23.440><c> was</c><00:37:23.530><c> just</c><00:37:23.800><c> like</c><00:37:24.040><c> it</c><00:37:24.430><c> just</c>

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
better and it was just like it just
 

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.970 align:start position:0%
better and it was just like it just
seems<00:37:24.940><c> to</c><00:37:25.060><c> have</c><00:37:25.180><c> a</c><00:37:25.210><c> good</c><00:37:25.500><c> impact</c><00:37:26.500><c> going</c>

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:26.980 align:start position:0%
seems to have a good impact going
 

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:29.550 align:start position:0%
seems to have a good impact going
forward<00:37:27.340><c> so</c><00:37:27.610><c> I</c><00:37:27.910><c> definitely</c><00:37:28.450><c> like</c><00:37:29.020><c> that's</c><00:37:29.260><c> one</c>

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
forward so I definitely like that's one
 

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:31.650 align:start position:0%
forward so I definitely like that's one
that<00:37:29.800><c> I</c><00:37:29.860><c> do</c><00:37:30.010><c> think</c><00:37:30.490><c> people</c><00:37:30.790><c> like</c><00:37:30.970><c> oh</c><00:37:31.180><c> it</c><00:37:31.420><c> seems</c>

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:31.660 align:start position:0%
that I do think people like oh it seems
 

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
that I do think people like oh it seems
kind<00:37:31.840><c> of</c><00:37:31.870><c> high</c><00:37:31.990><c> P</c><00:37:32.050><c> but</c><00:37:32.320><c> I</c><00:37:32.410><c> think</c><00:37:32.620><c> the</c><00:37:32.710><c> science</c>

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.010 align:start position:0%
kind of high P but I think the science
 

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.970 align:start position:0%
kind of high P but I think the science
is<00:37:33.160><c> there</c><00:37:33.430><c> so</c><00:37:33.970><c> I</c><00:37:34.000><c> have</c><00:37:34.240><c> 24</c><00:37:34.660><c> hours</c><00:37:34.960><c> I</c><00:37:35.260><c> do</c><00:37:35.470><c> it</c><00:37:35.710><c> from</c>

interesting but yeah you're kind of like
 

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.630 align:start position:0%

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
slower during that fasted State well my
 

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.150 align:start position:0%
slower during that fasted State well my
brain<00:37:48.880><c> just</c><00:37:48.910><c> doesn't</c><00:37:49.270><c> work</c><00:37:49.510><c> at</c><00:37:49.690><c> all</c>

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
brain just doesn't work at all
 

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
brain just doesn't work at all
completely<00:37:51.210><c> it's</c><00:37:52.210><c> completely</c><00:37:52.990><c> you</c><00:37:53.680><c> know</c><00:37:53.710><c> just</c>

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.130 align:start position:0%
completely it's completely you know just
 

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
completely it's completely you know just
have<00:37:54.280><c> to</c><00:37:54.400><c> watch</c><00:37:54.580><c> TV</c><00:37:54.850><c> or</c><00:37:55.030><c> do</c><00:37:55.570><c> nothing</c><00:37:55.960><c> useful</c>

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:56.170 align:start position:0%
have to watch TV or do nothing useful
 

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
have to watch TV or do nothing useful
because<00:37:56.800><c> I</c><00:37:57.070><c> can't</c><00:37:57.520><c> think</c><00:37:57.790><c> probably</c><00:37:58.560><c> but</c><00:37:59.560><c> so</c>

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.010 align:start position:0%
because I can't think probably but so
 

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
because I can't think probably but so
that's<00:38:00.160><c> that's</c><00:38:00.490><c> like</c><00:38:00.850><c> the</c><00:38:00.970><c> downside</c><00:38:01.390><c> of</c><00:38:01.510><c> it</c>

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:01.630 align:start position:0%
that's that's like the downside of it
 

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's like the downside of it
but<00:38:01.840><c> I</c><00:38:01.900><c> do</c><00:38:01.960><c> think</c><00:38:02.260><c> it</c><00:38:02.410><c> seems</c><00:38:02.800><c> like</c><00:38:03.130><c> it</c><00:38:03.340><c> has</c><00:38:03.580><c> um</c>

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:04.210 align:start position:0%
but I do think it seems like it has um
 

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
but I do think it seems like it has um
has<00:38:04.780><c> some</c><00:38:05.020><c> benefits</c><00:38:05.970><c> but</c><00:38:06.970><c> yeah</c><00:38:07.060><c> I</c><00:38:07.090><c> don't</c><00:38:07.300><c> take</c>

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:07.510 align:start position:0%
has some benefits but yeah I don't take
 

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:10.410 align:start position:0%
has some benefits but yeah I don't take
like<00:38:08.100><c> supplements</c><00:38:09.100><c> or</c><00:38:09.270><c> nootropics</c>

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:10.420 align:start position:0%
like supplements or nootropics
 

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.210 align:start position:0%
like supplements or nootropics
none<00:38:10.660><c> of</c><00:38:10.780><c> them</c><00:38:10.870><c> no</c><00:38:11.020><c> none</c><00:38:11.470><c> of</c><00:38:11.500><c> that</c><00:38:11.770><c> I</c><00:38:11.980><c> should</c>

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:12.220 align:start position:0%
none of them no none of that I should
 

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.130 align:start position:0%
none of them no none of that I should
probably<00:38:12.370><c> research</c><00:38:13.120><c> more</c><00:38:13.510><c> into</c><00:38:13.780><c> it</c><00:38:13.930><c> but</c><00:38:14.080><c> I</c>

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:14.140 align:start position:0%
probably research more into it but I
 

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%

actually look at the clinical data it
 

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
actually look at the clinical data it

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:46.570 align:start position:0%
majority don't really at all and so you
 

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
majority don't really at all and so you

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:48.730 align:start position:0%
get this kind of modest effect so if you
 

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.810 align:start position:0%
get this kind of modest effect so if you

do things like you know Paleo diet or

like you know any of those diets you
 

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.830 align:start position:0%
like you know any of those diets you
have<00:38:54.310><c> like</c><00:38:54.550><c> a</c><00:38:54.850><c> small</c><00:38:55.210><c> group</c><00:38:55.360><c> of</c><00:38:55.450><c> people</c><00:38:55.720><c> who</c>

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
have like a small group of people who
 

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
have like a small group of people who
actually<00:38:55.990><c> lose</c><00:38:56.380><c> quite</c><00:38:56.650><c> a</c><00:38:56.710><c> lot</c><00:38:56.860><c> of</c><00:38:56.890><c> weight</c><00:38:57.130><c> and</c>

00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:57.550 align:start position:0%
actually lose quite a lot of weight and
 

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
actually lose quite a lot of weight and
then<00:38:58.240><c> you</c><00:38:58.360><c> have</c><00:38:58.600><c> you</c><00:38:59.230><c> know</c><00:38:59.320><c> most</c><00:38:59.530><c> people</c><00:38:59.680><c> don't</c>

00:38:59.820 --> 00:38:59.830 align:start position:0%
then you have you know most people don't
 

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
then you have you know most people don't
really<00:39:00.220><c> lose</c><00:39:00.370><c> much</c><00:39:00.640><c> way</c><00:39:00.850><c> and</c><00:39:01.090><c> so</c><00:39:01.210><c> you</c><00:39:01.300><c> just</c>

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:01.450 align:start position:0%
really lose much way and so you just
 

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
really lose much way and so you just
have<00:39:01.540><c> a</c><00:39:01.630><c> small</c><00:39:01.810><c> effect</c><00:39:02.110><c> and</c><00:39:02.620><c> so</c><00:39:03.100><c> I</c><00:39:03.430><c> think</c><00:39:03.490><c> that</c>

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:03.850 align:start position:0%
have a small effect and so I think that
 

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
have a small effect and so I think that
it<00:39:04.480><c> would</c><00:39:04.630><c> make</c><00:39:04.810><c> sense</c><00:39:05.020><c> to</c><00:39:05.260><c> me</c><00:39:05.440><c> that</c><00:39:05.470><c> there's</c>

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.010 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to me that there's
 

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to me that there's
actually<00:39:06.580><c> you</c><00:39:06.850><c> know</c><00:39:07.450><c> different</c><00:39:07.930><c> responses</c><00:39:08.650><c> as</c>

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:09.010 align:start position:0%
actually you know different responses as
 

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:10.860 align:start position:0%
actually you know different responses as
