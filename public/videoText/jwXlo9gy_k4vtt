00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 align:start position:0%

graph<00:10:04.230><c> basically</c><00:10:04.950><c> you</c><00:10:05.310><c> want</c><00:10:05.460><c> to</c><00:10:05.520><c> have</c><00:10:05.610><c> a</c>

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:05.670 align:start position:0%
graph basically you want to have a
 

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.950 align:start position:0%
graph basically you want to have a
column<00:10:05.880><c> that</c><00:10:05.970><c> says</c><00:10:06.030><c> these</c><00:10:06.360><c> are</c><00:10:06.420><c> the</c><00:10:06.540><c> prices</c>

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
column that says these are the prices
 

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.900 align:start position:0%
column that says these are the prices
I'm<00:10:07.050><c> gonna</c><00:10:07.200><c> try</c><00:10:07.470><c> and</c><00:10:07.770><c> then</c><00:10:08.520><c> what</c><00:10:08.700><c> is</c><00:10:08.790><c> the</c>

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:08.910 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna try and then what is the
 

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna try and then what is the
result<00:10:09.240><c> in</c><00:10:09.360><c> conversion</c><00:10:09.870><c> rate</c><00:10:10.020><c> what</c><00:10:10.620><c> is</c><00:10:10.710><c> the</c>

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
result in conversion rate what is the
 

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.860 align:start position:0%
result in conversion rate what is the
result<00:10:11.100><c> in</c><00:10:11.220><c> sales</c><00:10:11.490><c> volume</c><00:10:11.610><c> and</c><00:10:12.120><c> then</c><00:10:12.600><c> how</c><00:10:12.720><c> much</c>

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:12.870 align:start position:0%
result in sales volume and then how much
 

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.730 align:start position:0%
result in sales volume and then how much
revenue<00:10:13.110><c> did</c><00:10:13.470><c> I</c><00:10:13.560><c> generate</c><00:10:13.980><c> that's</c><00:10:14.910><c> all</c><00:10:15.060><c> it</c><00:10:15.120><c> is</c>

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:15.740 align:start position:0%
revenue did I generate that's all it is
 

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.700 align:start position:0%
revenue did I generate that's all it is
and<00:10:17.210><c> so</c><00:10:18.210><c> let's</c><00:10:18.420><c> say</c><00:10:18.540><c> I</c><00:10:18.570><c> have</c><00:10:18.690><c> prices</c><00:10:19.170><c> at</c><00:10:19.410><c> these</c>

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:19.710 align:start position:0%
and so let's say I have prices at these
 

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.190 align:start position:0%
and so let's say I have prices at these
different<00:10:20.040><c> price</c><00:10:20.220><c> points</c><00:10:20.640><c> and</c><00:10:21.030><c> I</c><00:10:21.720><c> get</c><00:10:21.870><c> these</c>

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
different price points and I get these
 

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.710 align:start position:0%
different price points and I get these
different<00:10:22.620><c> conversion</c><00:10:23.160><c> rates</c><00:10:23.450><c> and</c><00:10:24.450><c> I</c><00:10:24.540><c> get</c>

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
different conversion rates and I get
 

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.590 align:start position:0%
different conversion rates and I get
this<00:10:25.080><c> sales</c><00:10:25.470><c> volume</c><00:10:25.950><c> I</c><00:10:26.390><c> should</c><00:10:27.390><c> immediately</c>

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
this sales volume I should immediately
 

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.010 align:start position:0%
this sales volume I should immediately
be<00:10:27.990><c> able</c><00:10:28.020><c> to</c><00:10:28.290><c> see</c><00:10:28.530><c> who</c><00:10:29.400><c> the</c><00:10:29.610><c> winner</c><00:10:29.640><c> is</c><00:10:29.960><c> here</c><00:10:30.960><c> we</c>

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
be able to see who the winner is here we

so that basically is like what at your
 

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.850 align:start position:0%
so that basically is like what at your
