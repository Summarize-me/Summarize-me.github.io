then you say you need to talk to
students<00:16:42.580><c> I</c><00:16:42.640><c> take</c><00:16:43.510><c> that</c><00:16:43.720><c> as</c><00:16:44.290><c> to</c><00:16:44.470><c> be</c><00:16:44.590><c> true</c><00:16:44.800><c> that</c>

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:45.340 align:start position:0%
students I take that as to be true that
 

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
students I take that as to be true that
means<00:16:45.430><c> if</c><00:16:45.580><c> students</c><00:16:45.940><c> really</c><00:16:46.180><c> do</c><00:16:46.360><c> want</c><00:16:46.660><c> these</c>

and they have a need the challenge that
we<00:24:04.370><c> found</c><00:24:04.520><c> there</c><00:24:04.730><c> that</c><00:24:04.760><c> they</c><00:24:04.910><c> have</c><00:24:05.060><c> quite</c><00:24:05.270><c> a</c>

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
long sales cycle the larger they get but
 

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:09.040 align:start position:0%

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.050 align:start position:0%
that's where the real need is as well so
 

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.210 align:start position:0%
that's where the real need is as well so
just<00:24:09.080><c> working</c><00:24:09.500><c> through</c><00:24:09.710><c> that</c><00:24:09.800><c> sale</c><00:24:10.010><c> cycle</c>

just working through that sale cycle
night<00:24:10.460><c> now</c><00:24:10.580><c> so</c><00:24:11.240><c> you</c><00:24:11.300><c> guys</c><00:24:11.510><c> you're</c><00:24:11.810><c> running</c><00:24:12.050><c> the</c>

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:12.140 align:start position:0%
night now so you guys you're running the
 

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.530 align:start position:0%
night now so you guys you're running the
pilots<00:24:12.560><c> um</c><00:24:12.860><c> when's</c><00:24:13.430><c> the</c><00:24:13.550><c> next</c><00:24:13.670><c> step</c><00:24:14.300><c> for</c><00:24:14.480><c> those</c>

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:14.540 align:start position:0%
pilots um when's the next step for those
 

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.210 align:start position:0%
pilots um when's the next step for those
pilots<00:24:14.990><c> but</c><00:24:15.260><c> they</c><00:24:15.350><c> become</c><00:24:15.620><c> like</c><00:24:15.800><c> pay</c>

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:16.220 align:start position:0%
pilots but they become like pay

pilots but they become like pay
customers<00:24:17.050><c> so</c><00:24:18.050><c> the</c><00:24:18.170><c> steps</c><00:24:18.710><c> are</c><00:24:18.830><c> typically</c><00:24:19.100><c> six</c>

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:19.460 align:start position:0%
customers so the steps are typically six
 

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.580 align:start position:0%
customers so the steps are typically six
months<00:24:19.790><c> three</c><00:24:20.690><c> to</c><00:24:20.780><c> six</c><00:24:20.990><c> months</c><00:24:21.200><c> to</c><00:24:21.230><c> a</c><00:24:21.320><c> pilot</c>

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:21.590 align:start position:0%
months three to six months to a pilot
 

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.170 align:start position:0%
months three to six months to a pilot
and<00:24:21.860><c> then</c><00:24:22.190><c> you've</c><00:24:22.550><c> got</c><00:24:22.640><c> a</c><00:24:22.670><c> time</c><00:24:22.880><c> after</c><00:24:23.060><c> that</c>

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:23.180 align:start position:0%
and then you've got a time after that
 

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
and then you've got a time after that
when<00:24:23.330><c> they're</c><00:24:23.480><c> evaluating</c><00:24:23.990><c> the</c><00:24:24.080><c> product</c><00:24:24.380><c> and</c>

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:24.530 align:start position:0%
when they're evaluating the product and
 

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
when they're evaluating the product and
then<00:24:25.040><c> they</c><00:24:25.130><c> do</c><00:24:25.190><c> a</c><00:24:25.280><c> rollout</c><00:24:25.610><c> it's</c><00:24:26.090><c> just</c><00:24:26.390><c> like</c><00:24:26.540><c> a</c>

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:26.570 align:start position:0%
then they do a rollout it's just like a
 

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.870 align:start position:0%
then they do a rollout it's just like a

probably<00:39:09.320><c> hit</c><00:39:09.500><c> that</c><00:39:09.650><c> with</c><00:39:09.770><c> a</c><00:39:09.800><c> typo</c><00:39:10.190><c> ten</c><00:39:10.460><c> ten</c>

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
probably hit that with a typo ten ten
 

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.380 align:start position:0%
probably hit that with a typo ten ten
thousand<00:39:11.450><c> times</c><00:39:11.690><c> right</c><00:39:12.730><c> and</c><00:39:13.730><c> so</c><00:39:14.120><c> when</c><00:39:14.360><c> I</c>

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:14.390 align:start position:0%
thousand times right and so when I
 

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.180 align:start position:0%
thousand times right and so when I
finally<00:39:14.600><c> like</c><00:39:14.870><c> because</c><00:39:15.530><c> I</c><00:39:15.620><c> did</c><00:39:15.800><c> it</c><00:39:15.890><c> like</c><00:39:15.950><c> five</c>

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:16.190 align:start position:0%
finally like because I did it like five
 

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
finally like because I did it like five
times<00:39:16.550><c> and</c><00:39:16.880><c> I</c><00:39:16.910><c> don't</c><00:39:17.000><c> know</c><00:39:17.120><c> which</c><00:39:17.270><c> password</c><00:39:17.930><c> I</c>

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:18.290 align:start position:0%
times and I don't know which password I
 

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.020 align:start position:0%
times and I don't know which password I
actually<00:39:18.770><c> got</c><00:39:19.040><c> accepted</c><00:39:19.160><c> yeah</c><00:39:19.700><c> so</c><00:39:20.000><c> I</c>

actually got accepted yeah so I
 

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.350 align:start position:0%
actually got accepted yeah so I
eventually<00:39:20.390><c> get</c><00:39:21.170><c> logged</c><00:39:21.410><c> in</c><00:39:21.680><c> and</c><00:39:21.980><c> I</c><00:39:22.820><c> sit</c><00:39:23.060><c> here</c>

00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
and it go back to the app to see any
 

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
and it go back to the app to see any
clues<00:39:58.530><c> about</c><00:39:58.560><c> it</c><00:39:58.890><c> and</c><00:39:59.010><c> there</c><00:39:59.280><c> really</c><00:39:59.400><c> isn't</c>

00:39:59.600 --> 00:39:59.610 align:start position:0%
clues about it and there really isn't
 

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:03.830 align:start position:0%
clues about it and there really isn't
anything<00:39:59.940><c> yeah</c><00:40:00.540><c> so</c><00:40:01.310><c> anyway</c><00:40:02.310><c> so</c><00:40:03.030><c> that</c><00:40:03.480><c> is</c><00:40:03.660><c> very</c>

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
anything yeah so anyway so that is very
 

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:14.230 align:start position:0%
anything yeah so anyway so that is very

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.950 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:40:14.900><c> in</c><00:40:15.400><c> you</c><00:40:16.400><c> know</c><00:40:16.520><c> in</c><00:40:16.760><c> rec</c><00:40:16.970><c> and</c><00:40:17.210><c> regular</c><00:40:17.540><c> office</c>

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
so in you know in rec and regular office
 

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
so in you know in rec and regular office
hours<00:40:18.109><c> we</c><00:40:18.710><c> in</c><00:40:19.609><c> regular</c><00:40:19.970><c> office</c><00:40:20.240><c> hours</c><00:40:20.510><c> we</c>

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:20.690 align:start position:0%
hours we in regular office hours we
 

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.260 align:start position:0%
hours we in regular office hours we
would<00:40:20.900><c> really</c><00:40:21.170><c> be</c><00:40:22.130><c> going</c><00:40:22.310><c> step-by-step</c><00:40:23.089><c> and</c>

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:23.270 align:start position:0%
would really be going step-by-step and
 

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:24.670 align:start position:0%
would really be going step-by-step and
and<00:40:23.570><c> really</c><00:40:23.720><c> figure</c><00:40:23.960><c> out</c><00:40:23.990><c> okay</c><00:40:24.200><c> what</c><00:40:24.380><c> would</c><00:40:24.560><c> be</c>

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
and really figure out okay what would be
 

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.290 align:start position:0%
and really figure out okay what would be
better<00:40:24.800><c> copy</c><00:40:25.070><c> here</c><00:40:25.280><c> what</c><00:40:25.640><c> are</c><00:40:25.730><c> the</c><00:40:25.820><c> individual</c>

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:26.300 align:start position:0%
better copy here what are the individual
 

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.210 align:start position:0%
better copy here what are the individual
thing<00:40:26.480><c> we'd</c><00:40:26.660><c> literally</c><00:40:27.230><c> just</c><00:40:27.500><c> got</c><00:40:27.740><c> called</c><00:40:28.040><c> for</c>

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:28.220 align:start position:0%
thing we'd literally just got called for
 

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.190 align:start position:0%
thing we'd literally just got called for
time<00:40:28.310><c> yeah</c><00:40:28.760><c> what</c><00:40:29.240><c> would</c><00:40:29.359><c> we</c><00:40:29.510><c> actually</c><00:40:29.930><c> change</c>

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
time yeah what would we actually change
 

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
time yeah what would we actually change
in<00:40:30.320><c> every</c><00:40:30.589><c> single</c><00:40:30.859><c> one</c><00:40:30.950><c> of</c><00:40:31.010><c> those</c><00:40:31.130><c> screens</c><00:40:31.369><c> and</c>

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:31.490 align:start position:0%
in every single one of those screens and
 

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
in every single one of those screens and
that's<00:40:31.609><c> very</c><00:40:31.760><c> tactical</c><00:40:32.240><c> and</c><00:40:32.420><c> it's</c><00:40:32.750><c> mundane</c>

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.050 align:start position:0%
that's very tactical and it's mundane
 

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.300 align:start position:0%
that's very tactical and it's mundane
boring<00:40:33.170><c> but</c><00:40:33.349><c> like</c><00:40:33.470><c> that's</c><00:40:33.650><c> what</c><00:40:33.890><c> building</c>

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:34.310 align:start position:0%
boring but like that's what building
 

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:37.510 align:start position:0%
boring but like that's what building
makes<00:40:34.460><c> all</c><00:40:35.150><c> the</c><00:40:35.270><c> difference</c><00:40:36.070><c> but</c><00:40:37.070><c> seeing</c><00:40:37.400><c> it</c>
