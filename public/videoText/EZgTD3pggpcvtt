I<00:12:28.949><c> even</c><00:12:29.310><c> bring</c><00:12:29.519><c> that</c><00:12:29.639><c> up</c><00:12:29.819><c> is</c><00:12:30.029><c> because</c><00:12:30.060><c> you</c><00:12:30.569><c> have</c>

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:30.750 align:start position:0%
I even bring that up is because you have
 

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.210 align:start position:0%
I even bring that up is because you have

it<00:12:35.550><c> grows</c><00:12:36.029><c> from</c><00:12:36.269><c> there</c><00:12:36.480><c> yeah</c><00:12:36.839><c> and</c><00:12:37.019><c> so</c><00:12:37.380><c> in</c><00:12:37.680><c> our</c>

00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:37.829 align:start position:0%
it grows from there yeah and so in our

you kind of focusing on and then you can

broader American society looks like in
 

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.330 align:start position:0%
broader American society looks like in

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
what its shifting to be yeah so we need
 

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.860 align:start position:0%
what its shifting to be yeah so we need
to<00:25:02.460><c> double</c><00:25:02.730><c> down</c><00:25:02.880><c> and</c><00:25:02.940><c> triple</c><00:25:03.480><c> down</c><00:25:03.570><c> on</c><00:25:03.630><c> those</c>

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:03.870 align:start position:0%
to double down and triple down on those
 

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.690 align:start position:0%
to double down and triple down on those
efforts<00:25:04.260><c> and</c><00:25:04.470><c> I</c><00:25:04.710><c> think</c><00:25:04.890><c> that</c><00:25:05.040><c> if</c><00:25:05.160><c> you</c><00:25:05.310><c> can</c><00:25:05.490><c> have</c>

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:05.700 align:start position:0%
efforts and I think that if you can have
 

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.210 align:start position:0%
efforts and I think that if you can have
that<00:25:05.910><c> conversation</c><00:25:06.530><c> and</c><00:25:07.530><c> keep</c><00:25:07.890><c> it</c><00:25:08.040><c> at</c><00:25:08.100><c> the</c>

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
that conversation and keep it at the
 

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.950 align:start position:0%
that conversation and keep it at the
business<00:25:08.580><c> level</c><00:25:08.640><c> then</c><00:25:09.360><c> it</c><00:25:09.450><c> becomes</c><00:25:09.720><c> less</c>

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
business level then it becomes less
 

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.570 align:start position:0%
business level then it becomes less
uncomfortable<00:25:10.560><c> I</c><00:25:10.710><c> guess</c><00:25:10.890><c> the</c><00:25:11.190><c> question</c><00:25:11.550><c> that</c>

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I guess the question that
 

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.730 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I guess the question that
I'm<00:25:11.790><c> asking</c><00:25:12.180><c> is</c><00:25:12.360><c> like</c><00:25:12.540><c> on</c><00:25:12.690><c> the</c><00:25:13.140><c> positioning</c>

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is like on the positioning
 

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.790 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is like on the positioning
side<00:25:14.010><c> so</c><00:25:14.340><c> like</c><00:25:14.520><c> outwardly</c><00:25:14.930><c> facing</c><00:25:15.930><c> how</c><00:25:16.440><c> do</c><00:25:16.500><c> you</c>
