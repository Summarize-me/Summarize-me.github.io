business and maybe find some edge cases
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.790 align:start position:0%
business and maybe find some edge cases
and<00:00:39.360><c> so</c><00:00:39.480><c> I</c><00:00:39.719><c> think</c><00:00:39.840><c> that's</c><00:00:40.020><c> worth</c><00:00:40.200><c> doing</c><00:00:40.440><c> for</c>

odds uh that YC is good fit for you is
pretty<00:00:47.760><c> good</c><00:00:48.000><c> and</c><00:00:48.480><c> then</c><00:00:48.660><c> let's</c><00:00:49.079><c> talk</c><00:00:49.320><c> about</c>

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good and then let's talk about
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.709 align:start position:0%
pretty good and then let's talk about
the<00:00:49.680><c> cost</c><00:00:49.800><c> benefit</c><00:00:50.100><c> analysis</c><00:00:50.879><c> of</c><00:00:51.239><c> applying</c><00:00:51.600><c> to</c>

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit analysis of applying to
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.290 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit analysis of applying to
YC<00:00:52.140><c> we</c><00:00:52.620><c> very</c><00:00:52.860><c> intentionally</c><00:00:53.460><c> designed</c><00:00:54.000><c> the</c>

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 align:start position:0%
YC we very intentionally designed the
 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.590 align:start position:0%
YC we very intentionally designed the
application<00:00:54.920><c> to</c><00:00:55.920><c> be</c><00:00:56.160><c> fast</c><00:00:56.699><c> and</c><00:00:56.940><c> easy</c><00:00:57.180><c> to</c><00:00:57.480><c> fill</c>

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
application to be fast and easy to fill
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.369 align:start position:0%
application to be fast and easy to fill
out<00:00:58.280><c> and</c><00:00:59.280><c> so</c><00:00:59.520><c> the</c><00:00:59.879><c> the</c><00:01:00.059><c> downside</c><00:01:00.719><c> is</c><00:01:01.020><c> you</c><00:01:01.140><c> apply</c>

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 align:start position:0%
out and so the the downside is you apply
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.349 align:start position:0%
out and so the the downside is you apply
and<00:01:01.440><c> you</c><00:01:01.559><c> don't</c><00:01:01.620><c> don't</c><00:01:01.980><c> get</c><00:01:02.160><c> in</c><00:01:02.340><c> but</c><00:01:03.120><c> you</c><00:01:03.239><c> only</c>

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
and you don't don't get in but you only
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.030 align:start position:0%
and you don't don't get in but you only
spend<00:01:03.660><c> a</c><00:01:03.780><c> tiny</c><00:01:03.960><c> bit</c><00:01:04.080><c> of</c><00:01:04.199><c> time</c><00:01:04.320><c> doing</c><00:01:04.500><c> it</c><00:01:04.680><c> versus</c>

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
spend a tiny bit of time doing it versus
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 align:start position:0%
spend a tiny bit of time doing it versus
the<00:01:05.339><c> potential</c><00:01:05.700><c> upside</c><00:01:06.060><c> being</c><00:01:06.299><c> very</c><00:01:06.540><c> big</c><00:01:06.720><c> man</c>

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
the potential upside being very big man
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.510 align:start position:0%
the potential upside being very big man
that's<00:01:07.439><c> that's</c><00:01:07.680><c> a</c><00:01:07.860><c> pretty</c><00:01:07.979><c> good</c><00:01:08.100><c> trade-off</c>

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's a pretty good trade-off
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.190 align:start position:0%
that's that's a pretty good trade-off
and<00:01:08.939><c> so</c><00:01:09.119><c> those</c><00:01:09.299><c> are</c><00:01:09.420><c> all</c><00:01:09.540><c> some</c><00:01:09.720><c> reasons</c><00:01:10.020><c> why</c>

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
and so those are all some reasons why
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.109 align:start position:0%
and so those are all some reasons why
it's<00:01:10.560><c> worth</c><00:01:10.740><c> applying</c><00:01:11.100><c> to</c><00:01:11.159><c> YC</c><00:01:11.520><c> I</c><00:01:11.880><c> want</c><00:01:11.939><c> to</c><00:01:12.060><c> talk</c>
