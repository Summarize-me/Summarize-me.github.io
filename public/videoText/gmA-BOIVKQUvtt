the<00:02:15.810><c> first</c><00:02:16.110><c> idea</c><00:02:16.590><c> was</c><00:02:17.070><c> well</c><00:02:17.460><c> why</c><00:02:17.730><c> don't</c><00:02:17.790><c> we</c>

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 align:start position:0%
the first idea was well why don't we
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
the first idea was well why don't we
build<00:02:18.240><c> a</c><00:02:18.480><c> discovery</c><00:02:19.020><c> kit</c><00:02:19.260><c> son</c><00:02:19.620><c> discovery</c><00:02:20.070><c> kit</c>

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 align:start position:0%
build a discovery kit son discovery kit
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
build a discovery kit son discovery kit
so<00:02:20.820><c> it</c><00:02:21.060><c> was</c><00:02:21.240><c> basically</c><00:02:21.540><c> it</c><00:02:21.810><c> looked</c><00:02:21.960><c> like</c><00:02:22.080><c> this</c>

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 align:start position:0%
so it was basically it looked like this
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.740 align:start position:0%
so it was basically it looked like this
if<00:02:22.680><c> you</c><00:02:22.830><c> can</c><00:02:22.980><c> see</c><00:02:23.160><c> basically</c><00:02:24.120><c> six</c><00:02:24.450><c> small</c>

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 align:start position:0%
if you can see basically six small
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.810 align:start position:0%

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 align:start position:0%
dollars for that and the idea was that
 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.700 align:start position:0%
dollars for that and the idea was that
if<00:02:29.730><c> they</c><00:02:29.850><c> liked</c><00:02:30.180><c> a</c><00:02:30.390><c> cent</c><00:02:30.690><c> they</c><00:02:31.200><c> would</c><00:02:31.440><c> purchase</c>
