so<00:00:33.870><c> it's</c><00:00:34.079><c> very</c><00:00:34.200><c> challenging</c><00:00:34.800><c> now</c><00:00:34.950><c> there's</c>

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 align:start position:0%
so it's very challenging now there's
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
so it's very challenging now there's
techniques<00:00:35.489><c> for</c><00:00:35.640><c> coping</c><00:00:35.969><c> with</c><00:00:36.000><c> that</c><00:00:36.239><c> and</c><00:00:36.480><c> some</c>

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 align:start position:0%
techniques for coping with that and some
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.150 align:start position:0%
techniques for coping with that and some
people<00:00:36.630><c> get</c><00:00:36.960><c> good</c><00:00:37.170><c> at</c><00:00:37.290><c> and</c><00:00:37.500><c> some</c><00:00:37.649><c> people</c><00:00:37.860><c> don't</c>

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
people get good at and some people don't
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740 align:start position:0%
people get good at and some people don't
but<00:00:38.550><c> that's</c><00:00:38.670><c> where</c><00:00:38.910><c> really</c><00:00:39.059><c> what</c><00:00:39.210><c> operating</c>

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
but that's where really what operating
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.290 align:start position:0%
but that's where really what operating
is<00:00:39.870><c> about</c><00:00:40.610><c> so</c><00:00:41.610><c> basically</c><00:00:41.940><c> what</c><00:00:42.149><c> you're</c><00:00:42.239><c> doing</c>

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 align:start position:0%

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
move recruiting you know first second or
 

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
move recruiting you know first second or

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:41.970 align:start position:0%

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
third somewhere and that yeah sort of
spectrum<00:43:42.569><c> it</c><00:43:42.960><c> was</c><00:43:43.020><c> your</c><00:43:43.200><c> number</c><00:43:43.380><c> one</c><00:43:43.500><c> priority</c>

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:43.530 align:start position:0%
spectrum it was your number one priority
 

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.010 align:start position:0%
spectrum it was your number one priority
then<00:43:44.069><c> about</c><00:43:44.549><c> 25%</c><00:43:45.359><c> is</c><00:43:45.420><c> probably</c><00:43:45.720><c> a</c><00:43:45.780><c> pretty</c><00:43:45.900><c> good</c>

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
then about 25% is probably a pretty good
 

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.710 align:start position:0%
then about 25% is probably a pretty good
