00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
think part of the problem is is that at
 

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
think part of the problem is is that at

they're<00:44:47.380><c> all</c><00:44:47.529><c> outliers</c><00:44:47.950><c> so</c><00:44:48.099><c> it's</c><00:44:48.400><c> not</c><00:44:48.549><c> like</c>

00:44:48.749 --> 00:44:48.759 align:start position:0%
they're all outliers so it's not like
 

00:44:48.759 --> 00:44:50.670 align:start position:0%
they're all outliers so it's not like
it's<00:44:49.119><c> there's</c><00:44:49.450><c> no</c><00:44:49.569><c> statistical</c><00:44:50.170><c> significance</c>

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
it's there's no statistical significance

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:51.290 align:start position:0%
that found that women the companies
 

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:53.950 align:start position:0%
that found that women the companies

00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:58.910 align:start position:0%
than I guess male founders I'm not sure
 

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
than I guess male founders I'm not sure
if<00:54:59.030><c> they</c><00:54:59.470><c> normalized</c><00:55:00.470><c> over</c><00:55:00.770><c> industries</c><00:55:01.250><c> yeah</c>

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:01.970 align:start position:0%

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:55:31.220><c> it's</c><00:55:32.680><c> that</c><00:55:33.680><c> would</c><00:55:33.859><c> make</c><00:55:34.010><c> sense</c><00:55:34.220><c> and</c><00:55:34.430><c> I</c>

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:34.490 align:start position:0%
yeah it's that would make sense and I
 

00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:36.250 align:start position:0%
yeah it's that would make sense and I
think<00:55:34.730><c> even</c><00:55:35.000><c> if</c><00:55:35.180><c> you</c><00:55:35.270><c> just</c><00:55:35.480><c> if</c><00:55:35.690><c> you</c><00:55:35.780><c> looked</c><00:55:36.109><c> at</c>

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:36.260 align:start position:0%
think even if you just if you looked at
 

00:55:36.260 --> 00:55:38.320 align:start position:0%
think even if you just if you looked at
it<00:55:36.290><c> like</c><00:55:36.830><c> kind</c><00:55:37.130><c> of</c><00:55:37.220><c> apples</c><00:55:37.550><c> to</c><00:55:37.609><c> apples</c><00:55:37.970><c> across</c>

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:38.330 align:start position:0%
it like kind of apples to apples across
