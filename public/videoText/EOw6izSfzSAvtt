00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
friction all that kind of stuff and so
that<00:02:45.340><c> was</c><00:02:45.520><c> really</c><00:02:45.760><c> powerful</c><00:02:46.000><c> for</c><00:02:46.240><c> me</c><00:02:46.540><c> because</c>

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 align:start position:0%
that was really powerful for me because
 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.350 align:start position:0%
that was really powerful for me because
I<00:02:47.140><c> realized</c><00:02:47.380><c> the</c><00:02:48.040><c> importance</c><00:02:48.550><c> already</c><00:02:49.090><c> of</c>

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
I realized the importance already of
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
I realized the importance already of
talking<00:02:49.870><c> to</c><00:02:49.990><c> your</c><00:02:50.050><c> users</c><00:02:50.470><c> yeah</c><00:02:50.860><c> but</c><00:02:51.130><c> then</c><00:02:51.250><c> also</c>

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 align:start position:0%
talking to your users yeah but then also
 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.450 align:start position:0%
talking to your users yeah but then also
like<00:02:52.140><c> seeing</c><00:02:53.140><c> their</c><00:02:53.380><c> problems</c><00:02:53.830><c> in</c><00:02:53.980><c> real</c><00:02:54.190><c> life</c>

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 align:start position:0%
like seeing their problems in real life
 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
like seeing their problems in real life
and<00:02:54.730><c> not</c><00:02:54.880><c> just</c><00:02:55.060><c> taking</c><00:02:55.360><c> them</c><00:02:55.480><c> at</c><00:02:55.570><c> face</c><00:02:55.750><c> value</c>

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 align:start position:0%
and not just taking them at face value
 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.390 align:start position:0%
and not just taking them at face value
so<00:02:56.380><c> that's</c><00:02:56.560><c> where</c><00:02:56.770><c> I</c><00:02:56.800><c> think</c><00:02:57.040><c> also</c><00:02:57.190><c> like</c>

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 align:start position:0%
so that's where I think also like
 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
so that's where I think also like
surveys<00:02:57.820><c> and</c><00:02:58.000><c> things</c><00:02:58.060><c> like</c><00:02:58.240><c> that</c><00:02:58.300><c> can</c><00:02:58.570><c> be</c>

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 align:start position:0%
surveys and things like that can be
 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
surveys and things like that can be
limiting<00:02:59.110><c> because</c><00:02:59.740><c> people</c><00:03:00.100><c> sometimes</c><00:03:00.430><c> a</c>

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 align:start position:0%
limiting because people sometimes a
 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
limiting because people sometimes a
can't<00:03:01.360><c> articulate</c><00:03:01.840><c> what</c><00:03:02.140><c> their</c><00:03:02.290><c> problem</c><00:03:02.650><c> is</c>

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.830 align:start position:0%

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
in the way that they want to but
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
in the way that they want to but
sometimes<00:03:04.990><c> there's</c><00:03:05.410><c> other</c><00:03:05.500><c> emotions</c><00:03:06.070><c> at</c><00:03:06.220><c> war</c>

interesting jobs for both of our songs
 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.630 align:start position:0%
interesting jobs for both of our songs
but<00:07:04.390><c> I</c><00:07:05.050><c> think</c><00:07:05.500><c> there</c><00:07:05.650><c> are</c><00:07:05.740><c> trade-offs</c><00:07:06.040><c> right</c>

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
but I think there are trade-offs right
 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.390 align:start position:0%
but I think there are trade-offs right
so<00:07:06.970><c> I</c><00:07:07.630><c> think</c><00:07:07.780><c> where</c><00:07:08.350><c> one</c><00:07:08.710><c> of</c><00:07:08.740><c> us</c><00:07:08.950><c> could</c><00:07:09.250><c> have</c>

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
so I think where one of us could have
 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
so I think where one of us could have
probably<00:07:09.610><c> accelerated</c><00:07:10.510><c> faster</c><00:07:10.780><c> or</c><00:07:11.080><c> further</c>

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 align:start position:0%
probably accelerated faster or further
 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.130 align:start position:0%

even stay in the same company yeah so I

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:26.630 align:start position:0%
of silly but it is communication right
 

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.570 align:start position:0%
of silly but it is communication right
so<00:10:26.870><c> I</c><00:10:26.900><c> think</c><00:10:26.990><c> people</c><00:10:27.770><c> don't</c><00:10:28.100><c> have</c><00:10:28.280><c> hard</c>

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:28.580 align:start position:0%
so I think people don't have hard
 

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
so I think people don't have hard
conversations<00:10:28.760><c> often</c><00:10:29.450><c> enough</c><00:10:29.840><c> and</c><00:10:30.370><c> deeply</c>

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.370 align:start position:0%

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.940 align:start position:0%
conversations often enough and deeply

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:33.950 align:start position:0%

certainly no tech industry background
 

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
certainly no tech industry background
yeah<00:20:52.300><c> I</c><00:20:52.510><c> quickly</c><00:20:53.110><c> saw</c><00:20:53.560><c> how</c><00:20:54.400><c> or</c><00:20:54.910><c> at</c><00:20:55.480><c> least</c>

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:55.690 align:start position:0%
yeah I quickly saw how or at least
 

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.230 align:start position:0%
yeah I quickly saw how or at least
hypothesize<00:20:56.470><c> how</c><00:20:56.770><c> you</c><00:20:56.830><c> might</c><00:20:57.220><c> you</c><00:20:57.850><c> know</c><00:20:57.970><c> solve</c>

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
hypothesize how you might you know solve
 

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.090 align:start position:0%
hypothesize how you might you know solve
that<00:20:58.480><c> okay</c><00:20:58.900><c> and</c><00:20:59.140><c> so</c><00:20:59.260><c> for</c><00:20:59.440><c> me</c><00:20:59.500><c> this</c><00:20:59.620><c> is</c><00:20:59.680><c> where</c><00:20:59.890><c> my</c>

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:00.100 align:start position:0%
that okay and so for me this is where my
 

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
that okay and so for me this is where my
chem<00:21:00.730><c> degree</c><00:21:01.030><c> kind</c><00:21:01.180><c> of</c><00:21:01.300><c> comes</c><00:21:01.420><c> back</c><00:21:01.510><c> and</c><00:21:01.780><c> I</c>

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:01.810 align:start position:0%
chem degree kind of comes back and I
 

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
chem degree kind of comes back and I
broke<00:21:01.990><c> it</c><00:21:02.020><c> down</c><00:21:02.200><c> into</c><00:21:02.410><c> like</c><00:21:02.680><c> a</c><00:21:02.710><c> nice</c><00:21:02.920><c> like</c><00:21:03.220><c> tidy</c>

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:03.490 align:start position:0%
broke it down into like a nice like tidy
 

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.550 align:start position:0%
broke it down into like a nice like tidy
equation<00:21:04.030><c> and</c><00:21:04.210><c> so</c><00:21:04.600><c> for</c><00:21:04.780><c> me</c><00:21:04.870><c> was</c><00:21:05.080><c> that</c><00:21:05.110><c> if</c><00:21:05.440><c> a</c>

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
equation and so for me was that if a
 

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.470 align:start position:0%
equation and so for me was that if a
village<00:21:05.770><c> is</c><00:21:06.040><c> a</c><00:21:06.070><c> function</c><00:21:06.550><c> of</c><00:21:06.730><c> you</c><00:21:07.390><c> know</c>

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
village is a function of you know
 

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.630 align:start position:0%
village is a function of you know
someone<00:21:07.810><c> that</c><00:21:07.840><c> you</c><00:21:07.990><c> trust</c><00:21:08.020><c> is</c><00:21:08.770><c> a</c><00:21:09.040><c> fit</c><00:21:09.370><c> for</c><00:21:09.520><c> your</c>

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
someone that you trust is a fit for your

someone that you trust is a fit for your

family from a like a values standpoint
 

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.710 align:start position:0%

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
and is there when you need them to be
 

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and is there when you need them to be
could<00:21:14.680><c> you</c><00:21:14.710><c> break</c><00:21:14.890><c> it</c><00:21:15.010><c> down</c><00:21:15.100><c> from</c><00:21:15.310><c> technology</c>

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:15.610 align:start position:0%
could you break it down from technology
 

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
could you break it down from technology
from<00:21:16.060><c> a</c><00:21:16.150><c> vetting</c><00:21:16.450><c> mechanism</c><00:21:16.990><c> a</c><00:21:17.230><c> matching</c>

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:17.950 align:start position:0%
from a vetting mechanism a matching
 

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.490 align:start position:0%
from a vetting mechanism a matching
algorithm<00:21:18.490><c> and</c><00:21:18.910><c> a</c><00:21:18.970><c> scheduler</c><00:21:19.390><c> uh-huh</c><00:21:19.870><c> so</c>

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:20.500 align:start position:0%
algorithm and a scheduler uh-huh so
 

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.650 align:start position:0%
algorithm and a scheduler uh-huh so
again<00:21:21.310><c> it</c><00:21:21.460><c> was</c><00:21:21.520><c> this</c><00:21:21.700><c> whole</c><00:21:21.970><c> thing</c><00:21:22.000><c> of</c><00:21:22.510><c> like</c>

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:22.660 align:start position:0%
again it was this whole thing of like
 

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
again it was this whole thing of like
let's<00:21:22.870><c> just</c><00:21:22.930><c> break</c><00:21:23.260><c> it</c><00:21:23.410><c> down</c><00:21:23.440><c> continually</c><00:21:24.130><c> and</c>

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:24.430 align:start position:0%
let's just break it down continually and
 

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.030 align:start position:0%
let's just break it down continually and
then<00:21:25.060><c> I</c><00:21:25.450><c> figured</c><00:21:25.870><c> okay</c><00:21:26.320><c> well</c><00:21:26.590><c> how</c><00:21:26.800><c> would</c><00:21:26.860><c> we</c>

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
then I figured okay well how would we
 

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
then I figured okay well how would we
test<00:21:27.250><c> that</c><00:21:27.430><c> her</c><00:21:27.520><c> and</c><00:21:27.640><c> I</c><00:21:27.670><c> could</c><00:21:27.850><c> see</c><00:21:28.060><c> an</c><00:21:28.150><c> app</c>

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:28.330 align:start position:0%
test that her and I could see an app
 

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.990 align:start position:0%
test that her and I could see an app
yeah<00:21:28.870><c> but</c><00:21:29.170><c> I</c><00:21:29.200><c> can't</c><00:21:29.440><c> build</c><00:21:29.620><c> and</c><00:21:30.490><c> so</c><00:21:30.760><c> for</c><00:21:30.970><c> a</c>

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
yeah but I can't build and so for a
 

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.850 align:start position:0%
yeah but I can't build and so for a
little<00:21:31.150><c> while</c><00:21:31.360><c> I</c><00:21:31.600><c> was</c><00:21:31.780><c> you</c><00:21:31.990><c> know</c><00:21:32.110><c> stressed</c><00:21:32.680><c> out</c>

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:32.860 align:start position:0%
little while I was you know stressed out
 

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.430 align:start position:0%
little while I was you know stressed out
about<00:21:32.980><c> that</c><00:21:33.810><c> but</c><00:21:34.810><c> then</c><00:21:34.930><c> finally</c><00:21:35.110><c> I</c><00:21:35.260><c> was</c><00:21:35.350><c> like</c>

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
about that but then finally I was like
 

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.830 align:start position:0%
about that but then finally I was like

do it yeah but you know you ought to
figure<00:22:01.960><c> it</c><00:22:02.049><c> out</c><00:22:02.230><c> yeah</c><00:22:02.470><c> and</c><00:22:02.710><c> so</c><00:22:02.830><c> finally</c><00:22:03.220><c> I</c><00:22:03.279><c> was</c>

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.230 align:start position:0%
even more and week after even more and
 

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.930 align:start position:0%
even more and week after even more and
so<00:25:48.260><c> I</c><00:25:48.380><c> think</c><00:25:48.500><c> more</c><00:25:49.070><c> than</c><00:25:49.220><c> the</c><00:25:49.279><c> actual</c><00:25:49.580><c> numbers</c>

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:49.940 align:start position:0%
so I think more than the actual numbers
 

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.639 align:start position:0%
so I think more than the actual numbers
it<00:25:50.120><c> was</c><00:25:50.210><c> this</c><00:25:50.299><c> idea</c><00:25:50.480><c> of</c><00:25:50.659><c> consistent</c><00:25:51.380><c> growth</c>

00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:51.649 align:start position:0%
it was this idea of consistent growth
 

00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
it was this idea of consistent growth
and<00:25:51.889><c> then</c><00:25:52.340><c> it</c><00:25:52.460><c> feels</c><00:25:52.700><c> different</c><00:25:53.179><c> when</c><00:25:53.240><c> you're</c>

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.010 align:start position:0%
and then it feels different when you're
 

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.860 align:start position:0%
and then it feels different when you're
not<00:25:55.010><c> pushing</c><00:25:55.460><c> people</c><00:25:56.029><c> to</c><00:25:56.179><c> try</c><00:25:56.360><c> your</c><00:25:56.510><c> product</c>

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.870 align:start position:0%

but<00:25:56.990><c> people</c><00:25:57.200><c> are</c><00:25:57.350><c> people</c><00:25:57.380><c> are</c><00:25:57.740><c> pulling</c><00:25:58.190><c> you</c><00:25:58.429><c> to</c>

00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
but people are people are pulling you to
 

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.060 align:start position:0%

give<00:25:59.149><c> them</c><00:25:59.360><c> more</c><00:25:59.600><c> that</c><00:26:00.289><c> felt</c><00:26:00.470><c> very</c><00:26:00.529><c> different</c>

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:01.070 align:start position:0%
give them more that felt very different
 

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.830 align:start position:0%
give them more that felt very different
and<00:26:01.250><c> so</c><00:26:01.279><c> anyways</c><00:26:01.970><c> that</c><00:26:02.149><c> was</c><00:26:02.179><c> the</c><00:26:02.419><c> genesis</c><00:26:02.809><c> of</c>

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:07.490 align:start position:0%
getting into YC the next time but I
 

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
getting into YC the next time but I
guess<00:32:07.610><c> the</c><00:32:07.730><c> point</c><00:32:07.850><c> by</c><00:32:08.029><c> that</c><00:32:08.210><c> time</c><00:32:08.480><c> also</c><00:32:08.840><c> was</c>

as best as I can tell I look at it a
couple<00:35:56.610><c> of</c><00:35:56.760><c> different</c><00:35:57.060><c> ways</c><00:35:57.150><c> okay</c><00:35:57.600><c> um</c><00:35:57.810><c> one</c><00:35:58.320><c> I</c>

00:35:58.610 --> 00:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways okay um one I
 

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.460 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways okay um one I
think<00:35:58.740><c> is</c><00:35:59.610><c> from</c><00:36:00.330><c> a</c><00:36:00.390><c> retention</c><00:36:00.720><c> point</c><00:36:01.170><c> of</c><00:36:01.320><c> view</c>

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:01.470 align:start position:0%
think is from a retention point of view
 

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.950 align:start position:0%
think is from a retention point of view

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:56.440 align:start position:0%

think that's the biggest thing is that
 

00:47:03.299 --> 00:47:05.059 align:start position:0%
think that's the biggest thing is that
you<00:47:03.390><c> have</c><00:47:03.599><c> to</c><00:47:03.750><c> get</c><00:47:03.869><c> started</c><00:47:04.259><c> and</c><00:47:04.380><c> just</c><00:47:04.440><c> going</c>
