that<00:05:58.910><c> you</c><00:05:58.970><c> were</c><00:05:59.030><c> actually</c><00:05:59.270><c> going</c><00:05:59.360><c> to</c><00:05:59.450><c> do</c><00:05:59.630><c> that</c>

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 align:start position:0%

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:24.910 align:start position:0%
make some progress if we could just move
 

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.410 align:start position:0%
make some progress if we could just move
the<00:09:24.970><c> ball</c><00:09:25.089><c> forward</c><00:09:25.420><c> even</c><00:09:26.230><c> if</c><00:09:26.319><c> we</c><00:09:26.410><c> died</c><00:09:26.589><c> maybe</c>

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
the ball forward even if we died maybe
 

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.490 align:start position:0%
the ball forward even if we died maybe
some<00:09:28.420><c> other</c><00:09:28.569><c> company</c><00:09:28.839><c> could</c><00:09:28.990><c> pick</c><00:09:29.199><c> up</c><00:09:29.350><c> the</c>

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:29.500 align:start position:0%
some other company could pick up the
 

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.990 align:start position:0%
some other company could pick up the
baton<00:09:29.620><c> and</c><00:09:29.980><c> move</c><00:09:30.129><c> and</c><00:09:30.490><c> keep</c><00:09:30.670><c> moving</c><00:09:30.939><c> it</c>

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
baton and move and keep moving it
 

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.999 align:start position:0%
baton and move and keep moving it
forward<00:09:31.620><c> so</c><00:09:32.620><c> that</c><00:09:32.709><c> were</c><00:09:32.800><c> still</c><00:09:32.980><c> do</c><00:09:33.100><c> some</c><00:09:33.250><c> good</c>

00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:35.009 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:09:36.009><c> same</c><00:09:36.490><c> with</c><00:09:36.579><c> Tesla</c><00:09:37.000><c> I</c><00:09:37.029><c> thought</c><00:09:37.240><c> your</c><00:09:37.629><c> odds</c>

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
yeah same with Tesla I thought your odds
 

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:39.150 align:start position:0%
yeah same with Tesla I thought your odds
of<00:09:37.959><c> a</c><00:09:38.050><c> car</c><00:09:38.230><c> company</c><00:09:38.439><c> succeeding</c><00:09:39.040><c> were</c>

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
of a car company succeeding were
 

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
of a car company succeeding were
extremely<00:09:39.939><c> low</c><00:09:40.240><c> what</c><00:09:40.930><c> do</c><00:09:40.990><c> you</c><00:09:41.050><c> think</c><00:09:41.199><c> the</c><00:09:41.319><c> odds</c>

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:41.470 align:start position:0%
extremely low what do you think the odds
 

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.869 align:start position:0%
extremely low what do you think the odds
of<00:09:41.680><c> the</c><00:09:41.800><c> Mars</c><00:09:42.009><c> colony</c><00:09:42.189><c> are</c><00:09:42.459><c> at</c><00:09:42.550><c> this</c><00:09:42.670><c> point</c>

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:42.879 align:start position:0%
of the Mars colony are at this point
 

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:46.619 align:start position:0%
of the Mars colony are at this point
today<00:09:44.939><c> well</c><00:09:45.939><c> um</c>

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:46.629 align:start position:0%
today well um
 

00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
today well um
oddly<00:09:47.589><c> enough</c><00:09:47.740><c> I</c><00:09:48.189><c> actually</c><00:09:48.430><c> think</c><00:09:48.970><c> they're</c>

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:49.870 align:start position:0%
oddly enough I actually think they're
 

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.509 align:start position:0%
oddly enough I actually think they're
pretty<00:09:50.230><c> good</c>

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
pretty good
 

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:55.710 align:start position:0%
pretty good
so<00:09:51.939><c> like</c><00:09:52.089><c> when</c><00:09:52.240><c> can</c><00:09:52.360><c> I</c><00:09:52.480><c> go</c><00:09:52.689><c> okay</c><00:09:54.480><c> at</c><00:09:55.480><c> this</c><00:09:55.629><c> point</c>

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
so like when can I go okay at this point
 

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.259 align:start position:0%
so like when can I go okay at this point
I<00:09:56.050><c> am</c><00:09:56.139><c> certain</c><00:09:56.529><c> there</c><00:09:56.680><c> is</c><00:09:56.889><c> a</c><00:09:57.160><c> way</c><00:09:57.430><c> I'm</c><00:09:57.850><c> certain</c>

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.250 align:start position:0%
Tesla and of course I I try to spend
 

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
Tesla and of course I I try to spend
it's<00:16:12.250><c> a</c><00:16:12.370><c> part</c><00:16:12.640><c> of</c><00:16:12.730><c> every</c><00:16:13.000><c> week</c><00:16:13.150><c> at</c><00:16:13.360><c> opening</c><00:16:13.810><c> I</c>

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:13.930 align:start position:0%
it's a part of every week at opening I
 

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's a part of every week at opening I
so<00:16:14.770><c> I</c><00:16:14.800><c> spend</c><00:16:15.070><c> most</c><00:16:15.220><c> I</c><00:16:15.640><c> spend</c><00:16:16.890><c> basically</c><00:16:17.890><c> half</c><00:16:18.040><c> a</c>

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.130 align:start position:0%
so I spend most I spend basically half a
 

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
so I spend most I spend basically half a
day<00:16:18.250><c> at</c><00:16:18.370><c> opening</c><00:16:18.670><c> I</c><00:16:18.760><c> most</c><00:16:19.000><c> weeks</c><00:16:19.240><c> and</c><00:16:20.110><c> then</c><00:16:20.290><c> and</c>

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:20.610 align:start position:0%
day at opening I most weeks and then and
 

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
day at opening I most weeks and then and
then<00:16:21.610><c> I</c><00:16:21.640><c> have</c><00:16:22.150><c> some</c><00:16:22.480><c> open</c><00:16:22.780><c> enough</c><00:16:23.110><c> that</c>

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:23.230 align:start position:0%
then I have some open enough that
 

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
then I have some open enough that
happens<00:16:23.470><c> during</c><00:16:23.710><c> the</c><00:16:23.860><c> week</c><00:16:24.510><c> but</c><00:16:25.510><c> other</c><00:16:25.630><c> than</c>

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:25.690 align:start position:0%
happens during the week but other than
 

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.570 align:start position:0%
happens during the week but other than
that<00:16:25.750><c> it's</c><00:16:26.080><c> really</c><00:16:26.470><c> traceable</c><00:16:26.950><c> interlaced</c>

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:27.580 align:start position:0%
that it's really traceable interlaced
 

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
that it's really traceable interlaced
like<00:16:27.700><c> so</c><00:16:27.820><c> Tesla</c><00:16:28.030><c> like</c><00:16:28.300><c> what</c><00:16:28.450><c> is</c><00:16:28.540><c> your</c><00:16:28.660><c> time</c>

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:28.870 align:start position:0%
like so Tesla like what is your time
 

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.830 align:start position:0%
like so Tesla like what is your time
look<00:16:29.380><c> like</c><00:16:29.530><c> there</c><00:16:30.330><c> yeah</c><00:16:31.330><c> so</c><00:16:31.510><c> it's</c><00:16:31.690><c> a</c><00:16:31.750><c> good</c>

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
look like there yeah so it's a good
 

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.690 align:start position:0%
look like there yeah so it's a good
question<00:16:32.170><c> um</c><00:16:32.380><c> I</c><00:16:32.620><c> think</c><00:16:33.100><c> a</c><00:16:33.280><c> lot</c><00:16:33.400><c> of</c><00:16:33.490><c> people</c>

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:33.700 align:start position:0%
question um I think a lot of people
 

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.730 align:start position:0%
question um I think a lot of people
think<00:16:33.910><c> I</c><00:16:34.000><c> must</c><00:16:34.480><c> spend</c><00:16:34.600><c> a</c><00:16:34.750><c> lot</c><00:16:34.900><c> of</c><00:16:34.930><c> time</c><00:16:35.230><c> with</c>

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:35.740 align:start position:0%
think I must spend a lot of time with
 

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.970 align:start position:0%
think I must spend a lot of time with

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:41.170 align:start position:0%
actually almost almost all my time like
 

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
actually almost almost all my time like
80%<00:16:41.530><c> of</c><00:16:41.950><c> it</c><00:16:42.040><c> is</c><00:16:42.160><c> spent</c><00:16:42.400><c> on</c><00:16:42.520><c> engineering</c><00:16:43.210><c> design</c>

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:43.690 align:start position:0%
80% of it is spent on engineering design
 

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:46.670 align:start position:0%
80% of it is spent on engineering design
in<00:16:44.410><c> engineering</c><00:16:44.980><c> and</c><00:16:45.040><c> design</c><00:16:45.310><c> so</c><00:16:45.580><c> it's</c>

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
in engineering and design so it's
 

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.030 align:start position:0%
in engineering and design so it's
