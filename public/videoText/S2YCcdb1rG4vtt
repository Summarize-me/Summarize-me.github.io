00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit what what what
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.180 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit what what what
was<00:02:26.610><c> it</c><00:02:26.640><c> about</c><00:02:27.030><c> the</c><00:02:27.510><c> culture</c><00:02:27.930><c> that</c><00:02:28.170><c> that</c><00:02:29.010><c> was</c>

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 align:start position:0%
bad so I think the main thing is there
 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.460 align:start position:0%

was<00:02:32.280><c> no</c><00:02:32.489><c> transparency</c><00:02:32.940><c> and</c><00:02:33.540><c> so</c><00:02:33.870><c> then</c><00:02:34.140><c> there</c><00:02:34.349><c> is</c>

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 align:start position:0%
was no transparency and so then there is
 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.830 align:start position:0%
was no transparency and so then there is

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 align:start position:0%

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 align:start position:0%
where you're going and of course you

where you're going and of course you

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%

like I didn't know four years ago how a

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 align:start position:0%
big front would be and I still don't
 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.229 align:start position:0%
big front would be and I still don't
know<00:03:58.170><c> today</c><00:03:58.519><c> but</c><00:03:59.519><c> I</c><00:03:59.549><c> think</c><00:03:59.790><c> that</c><00:03:59.880><c> will</c><00:04:00.030><c> just</c>

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
know today but I think that will just
 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.789 align:start position:0%
know today but I think that will just
evolve<00:04:00.660><c> along</c><00:04:00.870><c> the</c><00:04:01.019><c> way</c><00:04:01.170><c> what</c><00:04:01.410><c> you</c><00:04:01.440><c> need</c><00:04:01.680><c> to</c>

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
evolve along the way what you need to
 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
evolve along the way what you need to
have<00:04:01.980><c> is</c><00:04:02.190><c> just</c><00:04:02.459><c> what</c><00:04:02.730><c> you</c><00:04:02.880><c> deeply</c><00:04:03.209><c> believe</c><00:04:03.569><c> in</c>

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
have is just what you deeply believe in
 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
have is just what you deeply believe in
and<00:04:03.930><c> so</c><00:04:04.109><c> what</c><00:04:04.230><c> I've</c><00:04:04.380><c> always</c><00:04:04.739><c> believed</c><00:04:05.280><c> in</c><00:04:05.400><c> is</c>

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 align:start position:0%
and so what I've always believed in is
 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.129 align:start position:0%
and so what I've always believed in is
friend<00:04:06.359><c> should</c><00:04:06.510><c> be</c><00:04:06.540><c> a</c><00:04:06.630><c> place</c><00:04:06.870><c> where</c><00:04:06.900><c> people</c>

things that I would have not figured out

better<00:11:47.529><c> than</c><00:11:47.769><c> me</c><00:11:47.880><c> so</c><00:11:48.880><c> the</c><00:11:49.029><c> way</c><00:11:49.180><c> I</c><00:11:49.209><c> was</c><00:11:49.450><c> thinking</c>

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:49.779 align:start position:0%
better than me so the way I was thinking
 

00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
better than me so the way I was thinking
about<00:11:49.870><c> it</c><00:11:50.170><c> is</c><00:11:50.370><c> there</c><00:11:51.370><c> are</c><00:11:51.399><c> a</c><00:11:51.579><c> few</c><00:11:51.970><c> things</c><00:11:52.149><c> that</c>

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:52.450 align:start position:0%
about it is there are a few things that

about it is there are a few things that
I<00:11:52.480><c> feel</c><00:11:52.930><c> are</c><00:11:53.140><c> scalable</c><00:11:53.829><c> so</c><00:11:54.250><c> for</c><00:11:54.430><c> example</c><00:11:54.850><c> who</c>

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:55.269 align:start position:0%
I feel are scalable so for example who
 

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:57.210 align:start position:0%
I feel are scalable so for example who
would<00:11:55.390><c> have</c><00:11:55.510><c> leads</c><00:11:55.750><c> that</c><00:11:56.170><c> would</c><00:11:56.380><c> sign</c><00:11:57.010><c> up</c><00:11:57.130><c> to</c>

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:57.220 align:start position:0%
would have leads that would sign up to
 

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.530 align:start position:0%
would have leads that would sign up to
France<00:11:57.459><c> I</c><00:11:57.640><c> would</c><00:11:57.820><c> call</c><00:11:58.000><c> them</c><00:11:58.149><c> and</c><00:11:58.209><c> I</c><00:11:58.420><c> would</c>

00:11:58.530 --> 00:11:58.540 align:start position:0%

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:04.510 align:start position:0%
when when I started to think that
 

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.210 align:start position:0%
when when I started to think that
another<00:12:04.990><c> person</c><00:12:05.440><c> could</c><00:12:05.589><c> do</c><00:12:05.740><c> that</c><00:12:05.860><c> and</c><00:12:06.070><c> could</c>

another person could do that and could

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:07.779 align:start position:0%
it better than me because the person
 

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:10.170 align:start position:0%
it better than me because the person
would<00:12:07.930><c> be</c><00:12:08.050><c> more</c><00:12:08.440><c> skilled</c><00:12:08.860><c> then</c><00:12:09.399><c> that's</c><00:12:09.850><c> when</c><00:12:10.149><c> I</c>

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:10.180 align:start position:0%
would be more skilled then that's when I
 

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.139 align:start position:0%
would be more skilled then that's when I

00:12:15.329 --> 00:12:15.339 align:start position:0%
way I hired people better than me but
 

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%

someone will figure it out for me the

someone will figure it out for me the

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
out something I think it's very rare
 

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
out something I think it's very rare
that<00:12:33.070><c> someone</c><00:12:33.730><c> would</c><00:12:33.880><c> come</c><00:12:34.269><c> and</c><00:12:34.510><c> figure</c><00:12:35.320><c> it</c>

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:35.350 align:start position:0%
that someone would come and figure it
 

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
that someone would come and figure it

to them how that could be better with

are<00:34:46.010><c> different</c><00:34:46.310><c> sales</c><00:34:46.520><c> machines</c><00:34:46.850><c> you</c><00:34:46.970><c> can</c>

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
are different sales machines you can
 

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
are different sales machines you can
have<00:34:47.300><c> so</c><00:34:47.690><c> for</c><00:34:48.020><c> example</c><00:34:48.409><c> you</c><00:34:48.560><c> can</c><00:34:48.649><c> have</c><00:34:48.919><c> a</c>

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:49.250 align:start position:0%
have so for example you can have a
 

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.859 align:start position:0%
have so for example you can have a
bottom-up<00:34:49.700><c> approach</c><00:34:49.850><c> or</c><00:34:50.419><c> a</c><00:34:50.450><c> top-down</c>

00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:50.869 align:start position:0%
bottom-up approach or a top-down

bottom-up approach or a top-down
approach<00:34:50.929><c> so</c><00:34:51.740><c> top-down</c><00:34:52.639><c> you</c><00:34:52.879><c> sell</c><00:34:53.149><c> -</c><00:34:53.480><c> I</c><00:34:53.750><c> don't</c>

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.050 align:start position:0%
approach so top-down you sell - I don't
 

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:56.859 align:start position:0%

know<00:34:54.109><c> CIO</c><00:34:54.520><c> and</c><00:34:55.520><c> then</c><00:34:55.760><c> they</c><00:34:56.330><c> replay</c><00:34:56.810><c> the</c>

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.790 align:start position:0%
advice which is the temptation is to say
we're<00:47:58.480><c> going</c><00:47:58.510><c> to</c><00:47:58.720><c> raise</c><00:47:58.930><c> our</c><00:47:59.110><c> price</c><00:47:59.320><c> but</c><00:47:59.590><c> well</c>

00:47:59.790 --> 00:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to raise our price but well
 

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.830 align:start position:0%
we're going to raise our price but well
do<00:48:00.310><c> they</c><00:48:00.460><c> do</c><00:48:00.760><c> that</c><00:48:00.940><c> maybe</c><00:48:01.090><c> you</c><00:48:01.210><c> know</c><00:48:01.360><c> year</c><00:48:01.630><c> and</c>

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
do they do that maybe you know year and
 

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
do they do that maybe you know year and
so<00:48:02.020><c> you</c><00:48:02.050><c> want</c><00:48:02.290><c> to</c><00:48:02.320><c> be</c><00:48:02.500><c> nice</c><00:48:02.680><c> and</c><00:48:02.950><c> so</c><00:48:03.100><c> you</c><00:48:03.190><c> give</c><00:48:03.760><c> a</c>

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:03.790 align:start position:0%
so you want to be nice and so you give a
 

00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
so you want to be nice and so you give a

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:08.770 align:start position:0%
make your customers angry twice because
 

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:10.470 align:start position:0%
make your customers angry twice because
by<00:48:08.920><c> then</c><00:48:09.160><c> they</c><00:48:09.280><c> had</c><00:48:09.460><c> forgotten</c><00:48:09.670><c> and</c><00:48:10.150><c> so</c><00:48:10.330><c> then</c>

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
by then they had forgotten and so then
 

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
by then they had forgotten and so then
BAM<00:48:10.870><c> again</c><00:48:11.380><c> it's</c><00:48:11.830><c> almost</c><00:48:12.040><c> as</c><00:48:12.310><c> if</c><00:48:12.340><c> you</c>

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:12.550 align:start position:0%
BAM again it's almost as if you
 

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
BAM again it's almost as if you
increased<00:48:13.030><c> twice</c><00:48:14.190><c> so</c><00:48:15.190><c> one</c><00:48:15.760><c> trick</c><00:48:15.940><c> I've</c><00:48:16.150><c> used</c>

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:16.570 align:start position:0%
increased twice so one trick I've used
 

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
increased twice so one trick I've used
so<00:48:16.960><c> there</c><00:48:17.140><c> isn't</c><00:48:17.260><c> like</c><00:48:17.560><c> just</c><00:48:17.800><c> tell</c><00:48:17.980><c> them</c><00:48:18.220><c> and</c>

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:18.570 align:start position:0%
so there isn't like just tell them and
 

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:21.630 align:start position:0%
so there isn't like just tell them and
and<00:48:19.570><c> then</c><00:48:19.840><c> do</c><00:48:20.050><c> it</c><00:48:20.170><c> sooner</c><00:48:20.830><c> than</c><00:48:20.860><c> later</c><00:48:21.190><c> there</c>

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
and then do it sooner than later there
 

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.490 align:start position:0%
and then do it sooner than later there
is<00:48:21.730><c> no</c><00:48:21.760><c> good</c><00:48:22.120><c> way</c><00:48:22.180><c> to</c><00:48:22.360><c> do</c><00:48:22.540><c> it</c><00:48:22.630><c> one</c><00:48:22.930><c> work</c><00:48:23.140><c> trick</c>

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:23.500 align:start position:0%
is no good way to do it one work trick
 

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.570 align:start position:0%
is no good way to do it one work trick
that<00:48:23.680><c> I've</c><00:48:23.800><c> used</c><00:48:24.010><c> that</c><00:48:24.220><c> I</c><00:48:24.280><c> think</c><00:48:24.520><c> is</c>

that I've used that I think is
 

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
that I've used that I think is
