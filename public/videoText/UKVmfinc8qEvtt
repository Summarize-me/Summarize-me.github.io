00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 align:start position:0%

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:08.130 align:start position:0%
of software mhmmm so I think the biggest
 

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:11.630 align:start position:0%
of software mhmmm so I think the biggest
roadblock<00:38:09.130><c> is</c><00:38:09.460><c> sometimes</c><00:38:09.970><c> you're</c><00:38:10.900><c> sort</c><00:38:11.170><c> of</c>

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
roadblock is sometimes you're sort of
 

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.010 align:start position:0%
roadblock is sometimes you're sort of

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:15.610 align:start position:0%
would love for software to solve the
 

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
would love for software to solve the
problem<00:38:15.970><c> and</c><00:38:16.210><c> you</c><00:38:17.670><c> as</c><00:38:18.670><c> the</c><00:38:18.730><c> software</c><00:38:19.510><c> you</c><00:38:20.260><c> know</c>

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:21.450 align:start position:0%
problem and you as the software you know
as<00:38:20.470><c> a</c><00:38:20.500><c> technologist</c><00:38:21.130><c> you</c><00:38:21.280><c> have</c><00:38:21.369><c> an</c>

as a technologist you have an
 

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
as a technologist you have an

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:23.830 align:start position:0%
opportunity to move the needle that way
 

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:25.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to move the needle that way
but<00:38:24.010><c> also</c><00:38:24.040><c> I</c><00:38:24.760><c> think</c><00:38:25.210><c> it's</c><00:38:25.330><c> really</c><00:38:25.450><c> important</c>

00:38:25.859 --> 00:38:25.869 align:start position:0%
but also I think it's really important
 

00:38:25.869 --> 00:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
but also I think it's really important
when<00:38:25.960><c> we're</c><00:38:26.109><c> talking</c><00:38:26.260><c> about</c><00:38:26.650><c> a</c><00:38:26.950><c> more</c>

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:27.550 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about a more
 

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about a more
equitable<00:38:27.940><c> world</c><00:38:28.510><c> that</c><00:38:29.500><c> people</c><00:38:29.830><c> do</c><00:38:30.190><c> have</c><00:38:30.220><c> to</c>

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:30.550 align:start position:0%
equitable world that people do have to
 

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.490 align:start position:0%
equitable world that people do have to
change<00:38:30.820><c> and</c><00:38:31.180><c> so</c><00:38:31.660><c> the</c><00:38:31.780><c> biggest</c><00:38:32.080><c> roadblock</c>

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:32.500 align:start position:0%
change and so the biggest roadblock
 

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
change and so the biggest roadblock
probably<00:38:33.010><c> is</c><00:38:33.160><c> when</c><00:38:33.369><c> people</c><00:38:33.550><c> maybe</c><00:38:34.090><c> hope</c><00:38:34.510><c> that</c>

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:34.930 align:start position:0%
probably is when people maybe hope that
 

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
probably is when people maybe hope that
the<00:38:35.800><c> problem</c><00:38:36.130><c> can</c><00:38:36.220><c> be</c><00:38:36.340><c> solved</c><00:38:36.609><c> easily</c><00:38:36.820><c> without</c>

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:37.690 align:start position:0%
the problem can be solved easily without
 

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.450 align:start position:0%

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
planted it just like is a little bit
 

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
planted it just like is a little bit
self<00:55:47.040><c> reinforcing</c><00:55:47.280><c> and</c><00:55:47.910><c> so</c><00:55:48.390><c> I</c><00:55:48.690><c> would</c><00:55:48.810><c> not</c>
