of like story Point um uh so the way it
would<00:08:08.720><c> work</c><00:08:08.919><c> is</c><00:08:09.120><c> they</c><00:08:09.240><c> would</c><00:08:09.400><c> they</c><00:08:09.479><c> would</c><00:08:09.639><c> come</c>

would work is they would they would come
 

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:13.869 align:start position:0%
would work is they would they would come
up<00:08:09.840><c> with</c><00:08:09.960><c> these</c><00:08:10.240><c> scripts</c><00:08:11.240><c> and</c><00:08:12.080><c> uh</c><00:08:12.440><c> we</c><00:08:12.639><c> would</c><00:08:13.479><c> uh</c>

00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
up with these scripts and uh we would uh
 

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:17.830 align:start position:0%
up with these scripts and uh we would uh
uh<00:08:14.800><c> uh</c><00:08:15.680><c> so</c><00:08:15.919><c> they</c><00:08:16.479><c> sorry</c><00:08:16.720><c> they</c><00:08:16.840><c> would</c><00:08:17.599><c> the</c><00:08:17.680><c> first</c>

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh so they sorry they would the first
 

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.270 align:start position:0%
uh uh so they sorry they would the first
step<00:08:18.039><c> of</c><00:08:18.120><c> the</c><00:08:18.240><c> process</c><00:08:18.520><c> was</c><00:08:18.680><c> to</c><00:08:18.840><c> sort</c><00:08:19.039><c> of</c><00:08:19.159><c> come</c>

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
step of the process was to sort of come
 

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.589 align:start position:0%

there there's a couple of pieces here
 

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.069 align:start position:0%
there there's a couple of pieces here
but<00:10:34.360><c> like</c><00:10:34.760><c> one</c><00:10:35.000><c> is</c><00:10:35.120><c> that</c><00:10:35.279><c> when</c><00:10:35.440><c> I</c><00:10:35.600><c> first</c><00:10:35.760><c> showed</c>

but like one is that when I first showed
up<00:10:36.560><c> I</c><00:10:36.639><c> was</c><00:10:36.839><c> like</c><00:10:37.360><c> this</c><00:10:37.519><c> technolog</c><00:10:37.959><c> is</c><00:10:38.040><c> too</c><00:10:38.279><c> good</c>

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
up I was like this technolog is too good
 

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.310 align:start position:0%
up I was like this technolog is too good
right<00:10:39.040><c> like</c><00:10:39.920><c> like</c><00:10:40.160><c> if</c><00:10:40.399><c> if</c><00:10:40.519><c> this</c><00:10:40.720><c> were</c><00:10:40.920><c> a</c><00:10:41.040><c> real</c>

right like like if if this were a real
 

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.550 align:start position:0%
right like like if if this were a real
thing<00:10:41.600><c> P</c><00:10:41.880><c> Piper</c><00:10:42.240><c> would</c><00:10:42.440><c> never</c><00:10:42.720><c> fail</c><00:10:43.160><c> like</c>

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
thing P Piper would never fail like
 

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.269 align:start position:0%
thing P Piper would never fail like
there's<00:10:43.760><c> no</c><00:10:43.959><c> chance</c><00:10:44.480><c> right</c><00:10:44.720><c> like</c><00:10:44.839><c> they</c><00:10:45.040><c> could</c>

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
there's no chance right like they could
 

00:10:45.279 --> 00:10:47.190 align:start position:0%
there's no chance right like they could
not<00:10:45.560><c> fail</c><00:10:46.160><c> and</c><00:10:46.240><c> so</c><00:10:46.399><c> the</c><00:10:46.519><c> challenge</c><00:10:46.839><c> is</c><00:10:47.000><c> like</c>

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
not fail and so the challenge is like
 

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.310 align:start position:0%
not fail and so the challenge is like
how<00:10:47.279><c> do</c><00:10:47.440><c> you</c><00:10:48.079><c> like</c><00:10:48.320><c> make</c><00:10:48.560><c> them</c><00:10:48.760><c> fail</c><00:10:49.120><c> like</c><00:10:49.240><c> at</c>

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
how do you like make them fail like at

was<00:11:32.920><c> really</c><00:11:33.079><c> tricky</c><00:11:34.079><c> um</c><00:11:35.000><c> and</c><00:11:35.200><c> then</c><00:11:35.920><c> uh</c><00:11:36.959><c> uh</c><00:11:38.399><c> uh</c>

00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
was really tricky um and then uh uh uh
 

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:42.069 align:start position:0%
was really tricky um and then uh uh uh
what<00:11:39.519><c> was</c><00:11:39.839><c> the</c><00:11:40.839><c> oh</c><00:11:41.079><c> the</c><00:11:41.320><c> algorithm</c><00:11:41.760><c> at</c><00:11:41.880><c> the</c><00:11:41.959><c> end</c>

what was the oh the algorithm at the end
 

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:45.269 align:start position:0%
what was the oh the algorithm at the end
of<00:11:42.160><c> season</c><00:11:42.440><c> one</c><00:11:42.920><c> yeah</c><00:11:43.600><c> the</c><00:11:44.560><c> the</c><00:11:44.720><c> surprising</c>

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
thing with middle out is that like there
 

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.269 align:start position:0%

a piece of software that could exist um
 

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.389 align:start position:0%
a piece of software that could exist um

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh most likely it would not have the
 

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:12.949 align:start position:0%
uh most likely it would not have the

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
same kind of like characteristics that
 

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:15.629 align:start position:0%
same kind of like characteristics that

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
middle out does in the show um it's
 

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:18.030 align:start position:0%
middle out does in the show um it's
great<00:12:15.800><c> for</c><00:12:15.959><c> streaming</c><00:12:16.440><c> it's</c><00:12:16.760><c> lossless</c><00:12:17.760><c> um</c>

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
great for streaming it's lossless um
 

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.389 align:start position:0%
great for streaming it's lossless um
like<00:12:18.120><c> it</c><00:12:18.279><c> has</c><00:12:18.480><c> like</c><00:12:18.639><c> all</c><00:12:18.760><c> these</c><00:12:18.959><c> performance</c>

00:12:19.389 --> 00:12:19.399 align:start position:0%
like it has like all these performance
 

00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:21.990 align:start position:0%
like it has like all these performance
characteristics<00:12:20.120><c> which</c><00:12:21.079><c> uh</c><00:12:21.240><c> are</c><00:12:21.440><c> like</c><00:12:21.600><c> very</c>

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics which uh are like very
 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.389 align:start position:0%
characteristics which uh are like very
difficult<00:12:22.079><c> to</c><00:12:22.240><c> achieve</c><00:12:22.480><c> in</c><00:12:22.560><c> the</c><00:12:22.680><c> real</c><00:12:22.880><c> world</c>

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
difficult to achieve in the real world
 

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:24.910 align:start position:0%
difficult to achieve in the real world
okay<00:12:23.560><c> so</c><00:12:23.720><c> like</c><00:12:23.839><c> if</c><00:12:24.000><c> this</c><00:12:24.120><c> thing</c><00:12:24.440><c> existed</c><00:12:24.800><c> in</c>

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
okay so like if this thing existed in
 

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.269 align:start position:0%
okay so like if this thing existed in
the<00:12:25.000><c> real</c><00:12:25.160><c> world</c><00:12:25.399><c> it'd</c><00:12:25.600><c> be</c><00:12:25.959><c> like</c><00:12:26.600><c> no</c><00:12:26.800><c> question</c>

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
the real world it'd be like no question
 

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.910 align:start position:0%
the real world it'd be like no question
absolute<00:12:27.639><c> breakthrough</c><00:12:28.399><c> but</c><00:12:28.560><c> wait</c><00:12:28.760><c> why</c>

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
absolute breakthrough but wait why
 

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.350 align:start position:0%
absolute breakthrough but wait why
wouldn't<00:12:29.519><c> exist</c><00:12:29.880><c> what</c><00:12:29.959><c> are</c><00:12:30.160><c> the</c><00:12:30.399><c> issues</c><00:12:30.800><c> there</c>

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't exist what are the issues there
 

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.870 align:start position:0%
wouldn't exist what are the issues there
it<00:12:31.519><c> just</c><00:12:32.000><c> because</c><00:12:33.240><c> well</c><00:12:34.240><c> it</c><00:12:34.360><c> would</c><00:12:34.680><c> it</c><00:12:34.760><c> would</c>

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
it just because well it would it would
 

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.509 align:start position:0%
it just because well it would it would
just<00:12:35.000><c> be</c><00:12:35.320><c> a</c><00:12:35.440><c> scientific</c><00:12:35.920><c> breakthrough</c><00:12:36.360><c> for</c>

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
just be a scientific breakthrough for
 

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:38.389 align:start position:0%
just be a scientific breakthrough for
something<00:12:36.880><c> like</c><00:12:37.079><c> like</c><00:12:37.279><c> middle</c><00:12:37.480><c> out</c><00:12:37.680><c> to</c><00:12:37.839><c> exist</c>

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
something like like middle out to exist
 

00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
something like like middle out to exist
okay<00:12:38.760><c> gotcha</c><00:12:39.240><c> that's</c><00:12:39.399><c> what</c><00:12:39.480><c> it</c><00:12:39.600><c> comes</c><00:12:39.800><c> down</c><00:12:39.959><c> to</c>

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha that's what it comes down to
 

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.150 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha that's what it comes down to
okay<00:12:40.839><c> gotcha</c><00:12:41.760><c> um</c><00:12:42.199><c> so</c><00:12:42.519><c> one</c><00:12:42.639><c> of</c><00:12:42.720><c> the</c><00:12:42.839><c> things</c><00:12:43.040><c> that</c>

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:43.160 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha um so one of the things that
 

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.030 align:start position:0%
okay gotcha um so one of the things that
I<00:12:43.240><c> was</c><00:12:43.360><c> wondering</c><00:12:43.720><c> is</c><00:12:44.120><c> like</c><00:12:45.120><c> often</c><00:12:45.519><c> times</c><00:12:45.839><c> we</c>

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
I was wondering is like often times we
 

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.590 align:start position:0%
I was wondering is like often times we
find<00:12:46.600><c> at</c><00:12:46.720><c> least</c><00:12:46.880><c> around</c><00:12:47.199><c> YC</c><00:12:48.120><c> that</c><00:12:48.279><c> you</c><00:12:48.399><c> know</c>

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
find at least around YC that you know
 

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.670 align:start position:0%
find at least around YC that you know
like<00:12:49.320><c> Google</c><00:12:49.920><c> or</c><00:12:50.160><c> hulie</c><00:12:51.040><c> isn't</c><00:12:51.320><c> going</c><00:12:51.440><c> to</c>

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
like Google or hulie isn't going to
 

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.590 align:start position:0%

new right like that didn't used to be
 

00:13:37.079 --> 00:13:40.189 align:start position:0%
new right like that didn't used to be
the<00:13:37.279><c> case</c><00:13:38.199><c> um</c><00:13:38.560><c> so</c><00:13:39.000><c> so</c><00:13:39.240><c> now</c><00:13:39.480><c> I</c><00:13:39.560><c> think</c><00:13:39.760><c> it's</c><00:13:40.040><c> it's</c>

00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
kind of like plausible that we can say
 

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:42.790 align:start position:0%
kind of like plausible that we can say
like<00:13:41.800><c> oh</c><00:13:41.920><c> well</c><00:13:42.040><c> the</c><00:13:42.160><c> big</c><00:13:42.279><c> company</c><00:13:42.560><c> is</c><00:13:42.680><c> not</c>

small<00:13:44.800><c> startup</c><00:13:45.279><c> but</c><00:13:45.519><c> like</c><00:13:46.199><c> I</c><00:13:46.279><c> think</c><00:13:46.440><c> that's</c><00:13:46.560><c> a</c>

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
small startup but like I think that's a
 

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.269 align:start position:0%
small startup but like I think that's a

00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
smaller spaces and so um yeah I think
 

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.910 align:start position:0%
smaller spaces and so um yeah I think
that<00:13:58.600><c> that</c><00:13:58.839><c> that</c><00:13:58.959><c> is</c><00:13:59.360><c> like</c><00:13:59.519><c> a</c><00:13:59.759><c> a</c><00:14:00.000><c> legitimate</c>

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
algorithm but like uh took this this
 

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.630 align:start position:0%
algorithm but like uh took this this
character<00:22:10.840><c> string</c><00:22:11.799><c> um</c><00:22:12.000><c> and</c><00:22:12.120><c> you</c><00:22:12.279><c> could</c><00:22:12.559><c> you</c>

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
character string um and you could you
 

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.590 align:start position:0%
character string um and you could you
could<00:22:12.840><c> decompress</c><00:22:13.400><c> it</c><00:22:13.600><c> expand</c><00:22:13.880><c> it</c><00:22:14.039><c> into</c><00:22:14.360><c> a</c>

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
could decompress it expand it into a
 

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.950 align:start position:0%
could decompress it expand it into a
