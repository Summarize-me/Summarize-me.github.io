00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.410 align:start position:0%

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930 align:start position:0%
possible so therefore it would always

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:57.770 align:start position:0%
and the result is a software that just
 

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.470 align:start position:0%
and the result is a software that just
kind<00:10:57.920><c> of</c><00:10:57.950><c> like</c><00:10:58.010><c> mostly</c><00:10:58.820><c> just</c><00:10:58.970><c> works</c><00:10:59.210><c> right</c><00:10:59.390><c> out</c>

00:10:59.470 --> 00:10:59.480 align:start position:0%

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
recently when you were describing how
 

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
recently when you were describing how
Photoshop<00:11:26.030><c> was</c><00:11:26.480><c> putting</c><00:11:26.870><c> the</c><00:11:26.960><c> stroke</c><00:11:27.290><c> in</c><00:11:27.500><c> red</c>

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:27.770 align:start position:0%
Photoshop was putting the stroke in red
 

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.100 align:start position:0%
Photoshop was putting the stroke in red
and<00:11:28.010><c> that</c><00:11:28.700><c> was</c><00:11:28.850><c> prompting</c><00:11:29.330><c> users</c><00:11:29.660><c> to</c><00:11:29.900><c> learn</c>

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.110 align:start position:0%
and that was prompting users to learn
 

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.690 align:start position:0%
and that was prompting users to learn
the<00:11:30.350><c> settings</c><00:11:30.710><c> and</c><00:11:31.160><c> you</c><00:11:31.370><c> did</c><00:11:31.520><c> something</c>

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:31.700 align:start position:0%
the settings and you did something
 

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:36.390 align:start position:0%
the settings and you did something
similar<00:11:32.060><c> in</c><00:11:32.180><c> mucho</c><00:11:32.530><c> yeah</c><00:11:33.530><c> so</c><00:11:33.860><c> in</c><00:11:34.280><c> that</c><00:11:34.550><c> case</c><00:11:35.290><c> I</c>

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
similar in mucho yeah so in that case I
 

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.830 align:start position:0%
similar in mucho yeah so in that case I
do<00:11:37.400><c> this</c><00:11:37.580><c> talk</c><00:11:37.880><c> to</c><00:11:38.150><c> the</c><00:11:38.270><c> batch</c><00:11:38.450><c> about</c>

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
do this talk to the batch about
 

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.140 align:start position:0%
do this talk to the batch about
affordances<00:11:39.470><c> and</c><00:11:39.710><c> so</c><00:11:40.340><c> I</c><00:11:40.370><c> talked</c><00:11:40.700><c> about</c><00:11:40.730><c> like</c>

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:41.150 align:start position:0%
affordances and so I talked about like
 

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
affordances and so I talked about like
basically<00:11:41.570><c> there's</c><00:11:42.140><c> an</c><00:11:42.290><c> affordance</c><00:11:42.740><c> of</c>

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:42.890 align:start position:0%
basically there's an affordance of
 

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.740 align:start position:0%
basically there's an affordance of
something<00:11:43.280><c> really</c><00:11:43.490><c> ugly</c><00:11:43.670><c> especially</c><00:11:44.270><c> in</c><00:11:44.690><c> a</c>

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:44.750 align:start position:0%
something really ugly especially in a
 

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.230 align:start position:0%
something really ugly especially in a
design<00:11:45.080><c> app</c><00:11:45.290><c> or</c><00:11:45.500><c> a</c><00:11:45.880><c> Photography</c><00:11:46.880><c> app</c><00:11:47.030><c> like</c>

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
design app or a Photography app like
 

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.670 align:start position:0%
design app or a Photography app like
Adobe<00:11:47.630><c> Photoshop</c><00:11:48.050><c> and</c><00:11:48.170><c> so</c><00:11:48.290><c> when</c><00:11:48.410><c> you</c><00:11:48.500><c> put</c><00:11:48.650><c> a</c>

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
Adobe Photoshop and so when you put a
 

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
Adobe Photoshop and so when you put a

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.210 align:start position:0%
border on something the default was like
 

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.710 align:start position:0%
border on something the default was like

this three pixel dark red line and the

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:55.190 align:start position:0%
affordance of that is like designers
 

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.590 align:start position:0%
affordance of that is like designers

you have to really sort of earn it
because<00:33:41.519><c> by</c><00:33:41.669><c> that</c><00:33:41.700><c> time</c><00:33:41.879><c> we</c><00:33:42.059><c> had</c><00:33:42.179><c> to</c><00:33:42.419><c> risk</c><00:33:43.169><c> a</c>

because by that time we had to risk a

because by that time we had to risk a

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:47.610 align:start position:0%
feel like the revenues were just
 

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:51.259 align:start position:0%
feel like the revenues were just

00:33:51.259 --> 00:33:51.269 align:start position:0%
basically almost doubling every year and
 

00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:53.269 align:start position:0%
basically almost doubling every year and

00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
so with the profit sharing my salary was
 

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:56.090 align:start position:0%
so with the profit sharing my salary was

actually doubling every year we the
 

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.609 align:start position:0%
actually doubling every year we the

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
different kind of life but it's like I
 

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
different kind of life but it's like I
felt<00:37:23.910><c> like</c><00:37:23.999><c> we</c><00:37:24.660><c> had</c><00:37:24.690><c> product</c><00:37:25.259><c> market</c><00:37:25.799><c> fit</c><00:37:26.930><c> but</c>

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:27.930 align:start position:0%
felt like we had product market fit but
 

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.350 align:start position:0%
felt like we had product market fit but
it<00:37:27.989><c> was</c><00:37:28.109><c> controlled</c><00:37:28.829><c> yeah</c>

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
it was controlled yeah
 

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.450 align:start position:0%
it was controlled yeah
so<00:37:30.540><c> to</c><00:37:30.600><c> me</c><00:37:31.140><c> it's</c><00:37:31.350><c> like</c><00:37:32.810><c> it's</c><00:37:33.810><c> just</c><00:37:33.960><c> different</c>

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:34.460 align:start position:0%
so to me it's like it's just different
 

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:38.060 align:start position:0%
so to me it's like it's just different
like<00:37:36.200><c> there's</c><00:37:37.200><c> an</c><00:37:37.320><c> argument</c><00:37:37.500><c> that</c><00:37:37.740><c> you</c><00:37:37.890><c> make</c>

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:38.070 align:start position:0%
like there's an argument that you make
 

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.770 align:start position:0%
like there's an argument that you make
is<00:37:38.250><c> the</c><00:37:38.400><c> path</c><00:37:38.610><c> that</c><00:37:38.640><c> we</c><00:37:38.850><c> have</c><00:37:39.120><c> and</c><00:37:39.390><c> that</c><00:37:39.510><c> I</c><00:37:39.660><c> have</c>

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
is the path that we have and that I have
 

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.060 align:start position:0%
is the path that we have and that I have

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
figured out there's a rocket ship
they're<00:39:28.980><c> the</c><00:39:29.640><c> ones</c><00:39:29.940><c> you</c><00:39:30.000><c> mostly</c><00:39:30.360><c> hear</c><00:39:30.630><c> about</c>

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:30.810 align:start position:0%
they're the ones you mostly hear about
 

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.450 align:start position:0%
they're the ones you mostly hear about
but<00:39:30.990><c> I</c><00:39:31.230><c> would</c><00:39:31.290><c> say</c><00:39:31.500><c> like</c><00:39:31.650><c> those</c><00:39:31.950><c> are</c><00:39:32.100><c> actually</c>

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
but I would say like those are actually
 

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:34.970 align:start position:0%
but I would say like those are actually
more<00:39:32.640><c> common</c><00:39:33.060><c> for</c><00:39:33.270><c> YC</c><00:39:33.690><c> than</c><00:39:34.290><c> the</c><00:39:34.440><c> ones</c><00:39:34.680><c> who</c><00:39:34.890><c> are</c>

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
more common for YC than the ones who are
 

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:37.490 align:start position:0%
more common for YC than the ones who are

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
like steady growth and eventually bb-big
 

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:39:37.920><c> so</c><00:39:38.760><c> would</c><00:39:39.030><c> your</c><00:39:39.180><c> advice</c><00:39:39.270><c> then</c><00:39:39.630><c> be</c><00:39:39.930><c> just</c>

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:40.170 align:start position:0%
yeah so would your advice then be just
 

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:42.700 align:start position:0%
yeah so would your advice then be just
run<00:39:40.740><c> the</c><00:39:40.860><c> experiments</c><00:39:41.370><c> incredibly</c><00:39:41.850><c> cheaply</c><00:39:42.360><c> I</c>

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:45.570 align:start position:0%
you should always be frugal I think any

you should always be frugal I think any

why<00:39:54.690><c> you're</c><00:39:54.900><c> giving</c><00:39:55.020><c> up</c><00:39:55.260><c> the</c><00:39:55.350><c> equity</c><00:39:55.500><c> and</c><00:39:55.859><c> why</c>

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:56.070 align:start position:0%
why you're giving up the equity and why
 

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.190 align:start position:0%
why you're giving up the equity and why
you're<00:39:56.250><c> increasing</c><00:39:56.700><c> the</c><00:39:56.790><c> burn</c><00:39:57.000><c> those</c><00:39:57.840><c> are</c><00:39:58.020><c> two</c>

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
you're increasing the burn those are two
 

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
you're increasing the burn those are two
big<00:39:58.410><c> sacrifices</c><00:39:59.130><c> and</c><00:39:59.250><c> so</c><00:39:59.490><c> you</c><00:39:59.550><c> should</c><00:39:59.880><c> have</c><00:39:59.910><c> a</c>

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:00.090 align:start position:0%
big sacrifices and so you should have a
 

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:01.970 align:start position:0%
big sacrifices and so you should have a

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:05.340 align:start position:0%
giving up those two things are actually
 

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.340 align:start position:0%
giving up those two things are actually

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:07.350 align:start position:0%

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.230 align:start position:0%
going to result in growth I think a lot
of<00:40:07.470><c> people</c><00:40:07.650><c> will</c><00:40:07.770><c> give</c><00:40:07.920><c> them</c><00:40:08.130><c> up</c><00:40:08.340><c> prematurely</c>

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
of people will give them up prematurely
 

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.450 align:start position:0%

and<00:40:11.940><c> so</c><00:40:12.930><c> when</c><00:40:13.320><c> that</c><00:40:13.410><c> happens</c><00:40:13.770><c> it's</c><00:40:14.010><c> usually</c><00:40:14.280><c> a</c>

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:14.430 align:start position:0%
and so when that happens it's usually a
 

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:16.849 align:start position:0%
and so when that happens it's usually a

you know if your product just isn't even
noticed<00:41:14.070><c> yet</c><00:41:14.369><c> and</c><00:41:15.020><c> so</c><00:41:16.020><c> I</c><00:41:16.050><c> mean</c><00:41:16.320><c> I</c><00:41:16.350><c> think</c><00:41:16.410><c> you</c>

00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
noticed yet and so I mean I think you
 

00:41:16.619 --> 00:41:17.930 align:start position:0%
noticed yet and so I mean I think you
could<00:41:16.770><c> lump</c><00:41:17.100><c> this</c><00:41:17.190><c> into</c><00:41:17.400><c> the</c><00:41:17.490><c> category</c><00:41:17.880><c> of</c>

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
could lump this into the category of
 

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.250 align:start position:0%
could lump this into the category of
like<00:41:18.119><c> do</c><00:41:18.300><c> you</c><00:41:18.390><c> have</c><00:41:18.420><c> a</c><00:41:18.570><c> hundred</c><00:41:18.930><c> people</c><00:41:19.050><c> that</c>

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
like do you have a hundred people that

love<00:41:19.440><c> it</c><00:41:19.550><c> but</c><00:41:20.550><c> what</c><00:41:20.880><c> would</c><00:41:21.030><c> you</c><00:41:21.119><c> say</c><00:41:21.270><c> to</c><00:41:21.330><c> that</c>

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%

what<00:43:03.990><c> would</c><00:43:04.080><c> have</c><00:43:04.230><c> to</c><00:43:04.320><c> figure</c><00:43:04.530><c> out</c><00:43:05.030><c> and</c><00:43:06.030><c> then</c>

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:06.390 align:start position:0%
what would have to figure out and then
 

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
what would have to figure out and then
you'd<00:43:06.540><c> like</c><00:43:06.720><c> time</c><00:43:06.960><c> box</c><00:43:07.170><c> it</c><00:43:07.320><c> cuz</c><00:43:07.560><c> like</c><00:43:07.770><c> once</c><00:43:08.520><c> you</c>

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:08.610 align:start position:0%

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.010 align:start position:0%
run out of money it's game over and then
 

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:14.690 align:start position:0%
