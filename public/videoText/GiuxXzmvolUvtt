00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
see to go through
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.030 align:start position:0%
see to go through
some<00:02:19.599><c> of</c><00:02:19.680><c> the</c><00:02:19.760><c> stuff</c><00:02:20.000><c> i've</c><00:02:20.160><c> noticed</c><00:02:20.640><c> so</c><00:02:20.879><c> for</c>

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff i've noticed so for
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.910 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff i've noticed so for
one<00:02:21.440><c> um</c><00:02:22.000><c> more</c><00:02:22.239><c> applications</c>

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
one um more applications
 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.309 align:start position:0%
one um more applications
um<00:02:24.720><c> i</c><00:02:24.879><c> think</c><00:02:25.120><c> that's</c>

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
um i think that's
 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.309 align:start position:0%
um i think that's
that's<00:02:26.720><c> i</c><00:02:26.800><c> think</c><00:02:26.879><c> that's</c><00:02:27.120><c> always</c><00:02:27.360><c> a</c><00:02:27.520><c> trend</c><00:02:27.920><c> but</c>

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's i think that's always a trend but
 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.470 align:start position:0%
that's i think that's always a trend but
there's<00:02:28.560><c> definitely</c><00:02:28.959><c> more</c><00:02:29.200><c> applications</c><00:02:30.000><c> and</c>

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's definitely more applications and
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.110 align:start position:0%
there's definitely more applications and
you<00:02:30.640><c> know</c><00:02:31.040><c> i</c><00:02:31.200><c> think</c><00:02:31.440><c> the</c><00:02:31.680><c> uh</c><00:02:32.080><c> the</c><00:02:32.239><c> new</c><00:02:32.480><c> yc</c><00:02:32.800><c> deal</c>

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
you know i think the uh the new yc deal
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
you know i think the uh the new yc deal
doesn't<00:02:33.440><c> hurt</c><00:02:34.000><c> on</c><00:02:34.160><c> that</c><00:02:34.319><c> one</c><00:02:34.800><c> um</c><00:02:35.360><c> and</c><00:02:35.440><c> so</c><00:02:35.599><c> yeah</c>

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt on that one um and so yeah
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt on that one um and so yeah
more<00:02:36.000><c> applications</c><00:02:36.480><c> more</c><00:02:36.640><c> applications</c><00:02:37.120><c> to</c>

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
raise
 

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.110 align:start position:0%

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
um four months and
 

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.509 align:start position:0%
um four months and
it's<00:11:09.600><c> interesting</c><00:11:10.079><c> because</c><00:11:10.480><c> i</c><00:11:10.640><c> think</c><00:11:10.880><c> that</c><00:11:11.200><c> in</c>

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because i think that in
 

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:13.350 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because i think that in
some<00:11:11.760><c> ways</c>

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
some ways
 

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.710 align:start position:0%
some ways
um

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.990 align:start position:0%
um
it<00:11:14.959><c> was</c><00:11:15.200><c> conceived</c><00:11:15.920><c> of</c><00:11:16.399><c> competitively</c><00:11:17.760><c> people</c>

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
it was conceived of competitively people
 

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
it was conceived of competitively people
were<00:11:18.160><c> looking</c><00:11:18.399><c> at</c><00:11:18.480><c> the</c><00:11:18.560><c> yc</c><00:11:18.880><c> standard</c><00:11:19.120><c> deal</c>

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.630 align:start position:0%
new seed funds out there
and<00:11:25.200><c> i</c><00:11:25.279><c> think</c><00:11:25.519><c> what's</c><00:11:25.839><c> interesting</c><00:11:26.320><c> is</c><00:11:26.399><c> if</c><00:11:26.560><c> you</c>

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
and i think what's interesting is if you
 

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
and i think what's interesting is if you
would<00:11:26.800><c> kind</c><00:11:26.959><c> of</c><00:11:27.200><c> take</c><00:11:27.440><c> it</c><00:11:28.000><c> inside</c><00:11:28.399><c> baseball</c>

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
would kind of take it inside baseball
 

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.310 align:start position:0%
would kind of take it inside baseball
for<00:11:29.040><c> a</c><00:11:29.120><c> second</c><00:11:29.519><c> that's</c><00:11:29.760><c> really</c><00:11:30.000><c> not</c><00:11:30.160><c> the</c>

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
for a second that's really not the
 

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.710 align:start position:0%
for a second that's really not the
reason<00:11:31.120><c> we</c><00:11:31.279><c> did</c><00:11:31.440><c> it</c><00:11:31.600><c> at</c><00:11:31.760><c> all</c><00:11:31.920><c> like</c><00:11:32.399><c> take</c><00:11:32.560><c> us</c>

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
reason we did it at all like take us
 

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.069 align:start position:0%
reason we did it at all like take us
inside<00:11:32.959><c> baseball</c><00:11:33.279><c> a</c><00:11:33.279><c> little</c><00:11:33.440><c> bit</c><00:11:33.519><c> dalton</c><00:11:33.839><c> like</c>

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
inside baseball a little bit dalton like
 

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:35.910 align:start position:0%
inside baseball a little bit dalton like
what<00:11:34.240><c> was</c><00:11:34.399><c> the</c><00:11:34.480><c> strategy</c><00:11:34.880><c> behind</c><00:11:35.200><c> it</c><00:11:35.680><c> yeah</c><00:11:35.839><c> i</c>
