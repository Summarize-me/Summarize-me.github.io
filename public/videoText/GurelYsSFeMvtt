best<00:09:48.270><c> way</c><00:09:48.450><c> to</c><00:09:48.480><c> test</c><00:09:48.870><c> this</c><00:09:49.140><c> hypothesis</c><00:09:49.770><c> was</c><00:09:50.010><c> to</c>

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
best way to test this hypothesis was to
 

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.940 align:start position:0%
best way to test this hypothesis was to
have<00:09:50.430><c> the</c><00:09:51.000><c> right</c><00:09:51.240><c> selection</c><00:09:51.780><c> of</c><00:09:52.200><c> enough</c><00:09:52.740><c> items</c>

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:52.950 align:start position:0%
have the right selection of enough items
 

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.340 align:start position:0%
have the right selection of enough items
so<00:09:53.460><c> it's</c><00:09:53.580><c> not</c><00:09:53.670><c> just</c><00:09:53.730><c> one</c><00:09:54.090><c> dead</c><00:09:54.300><c> one</c><00:09:54.600><c> chair</c><00:09:54.930><c> one</c>

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:55.350 align:start position:0%
so it's not just one dead one chair one
 

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.220 align:start position:0%
so it's not just one dead one chair one
yeah<00:09:55.860><c> one</c><00:09:56.160><c> mattress</c><00:09:56.400><c> etc</c><00:09:56.940><c> yeah</c><00:09:57.210><c> but</c><00:09:58.020><c> to</c><00:09:58.110><c> have</c>

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:58.230 align:start position:0%
yeah one mattress etc yeah but to have
 

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
yeah one mattress etc yeah but to have
just<00:09:58.560><c> enough</c><00:09:58.700><c> so</c><00:09:59.700><c> that</c><00:09:59.730><c> you</c><00:09:59.910><c> can</c><00:09:59.940><c> actually</c>

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:00.930 align:start position:0%
just enough so that you can actually
 

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
just enough so that you can actually
accurately<00:10:01.800><c> test</c><00:10:02.040><c> whether</c><00:10:02.280><c> people</c><00:10:02.580><c> care</c>

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:02.970 align:start position:0%
accurately test whether people care
 

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
accurately test whether people care
because<00:10:03.240><c> that's</c><00:10:03.330><c> ultimately</c><00:10:03.510><c> what</c><00:10:03.930><c> it</c><00:10:04.020><c> needs</c>

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.290 align:start position:0%
because that's ultimately what it needs
 

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.510 align:start position:0%
because that's ultimately what it needs
to<00:10:04.470><c> look</c><00:10:04.620><c> like</c><00:10:04.680><c> and</c><00:10:05.180><c> what</c><00:10:06.180><c> I</c><00:10:07.020><c> did</c><00:10:07.170><c> was</c><00:10:07.320><c> I</c><00:10:07.470><c> put</c>

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
to look like and what I did was I put
 

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:13.370 align:start position:0%
to look like and what I did was I put
items<00:10:08.520><c> on</c><00:10:08.760><c> the</c><00:10:09.000><c> site</c><00:10:09.300><c> from</c><00:10:10.370><c> a</c><00:10:11.840><c> retailer</c><00:10:12.840><c> who</c>

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
items on the site from a retailer who
 

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.410 align:start position:0%
items on the site from a retailer who
could<00:10:13.650><c> ship</c><00:10:13.860><c> me</c><00:10:14.040><c> things</c><00:10:14.340><c> just</c><00:10:15.060><c> in</c><00:10:15.210><c> time</c>

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
could ship me things just in time
 

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
could ship me things just in time
effectively<00:10:16.250><c> so</c><00:10:17.250><c> when</c><00:10:17.550><c> a</c><00:10:18.450><c> customer</c><00:10:18.780><c> would</c><00:10:19.050><c> go</c>

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.170 align:start position:0%
effectively so when a customer would go
 

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.170 align:start position:0%
effectively so when a customer would go
on<00:10:19.290><c> our</c><00:10:19.380><c> site</c><00:10:19.590><c> they</c><00:10:20.460><c> would</c><00:10:20.580><c> place</c><00:10:20.790><c> an</c><00:10:20.940><c> order</c>

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
on our site they would place an order
 

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
on our site they would place an order
for<00:10:21.210><c> an</c><00:10:21.540><c> item</c><00:10:21.690><c> or</c><00:10:22.560><c> multiple</c><00:10:23.010><c> items</c><00:10:23.250><c> yeah</c><00:10:23.520><c> for</c>

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:23.730 align:start position:0%
for an item or multiple items yeah for
 

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.580 align:start position:0%
for an item or multiple items yeah for
their<00:10:23.820><c> home</c><00:10:23.940><c> and</c><00:10:24.150><c> I</c><00:10:24.600><c> would</c><00:10:24.780><c> then</c><00:10:24.930><c> in</c><00:10:25.110><c> turn</c><00:10:25.140><c> say</c>

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
their home and I would then in turn say
 

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
their home and I would then in turn say

00:21:43.289 --> 00:21:43.299 align:start position:0%
right off the bat so why not effectively
 

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:47.010 align:start position:0%
right off the bat so why not effectively
open<00:21:43.780><c> that</c><00:21:43.960><c> market</c><00:21:44.380><c> with</c><00:21:44.950><c> very</c><00:21:45.340><c> low</c><00:21:45.520><c> overhead</c>

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:47.020 align:start position:0%
open that market with very low overhead
 

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
open that market with very low overhead
so<00:21:47.560><c> I</c><00:21:47.590><c> did</c><00:21:47.830><c> that</c><00:21:49.140><c> you</c><00:21:50.140><c> know</c><00:21:50.790><c> it</c><00:21:51.790><c> was</c><00:21:52.030><c> a</c><00:21:52.060><c> I</c><00:21:52.570><c> think</c>

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:52.690 align:start position:0%
so I did that you know it was a I think
 

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.790 align:start position:0%
so I did that you know it was a I think
it<00:21:52.960><c> was</c><00:21:53.050><c> a</c><00:21:53.080><c> good</c><00:21:53.260><c> move</c>

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
it was a good move
 

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.430 align:start position:0%
it was a good move
ultimately<00:21:54.400><c> we've</c><00:21:54.880><c> learned</c><00:21:55.090><c> a</c><00:21:55.210><c> whole</c><00:21:55.390><c> lot</c><00:21:55.900><c> and</c>

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately we've learned a whole lot and
 

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.290 align:start position:0%
ultimately we've learned a whole lot and
it's<00:21:56.650><c> a</c><00:21:56.770><c> market</c><00:21:57.070><c> that's</c><00:21:57.190><c> that</c><00:21:57.730><c> does</c><00:21:57.940><c> very</c><00:21:58.150><c> well</c>

it's a market that's that does very well
for<00:21:58.360><c> us</c><00:21:58.600><c> so</c><00:21:59.760><c> yeah</c><00:22:00.760><c> so</c><00:22:01.240><c> just</c><00:22:01.450><c> try</c><00:22:01.570><c> well</c><00:22:01.960><c> because</c>

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:02.350 align:start position:0%
for us so yeah so just try well because
 

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.710 align:start position:0%
for us so yeah so just try well because

like with an Operations heavy business I
 

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.390 align:start position:0%
like with an Operations heavy business I

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
think you could make an argument for the
 

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
think you could make an argument for the

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:08.590 align:start position:0%
other side quite easily right like we
 

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
other side quite easily right like we
