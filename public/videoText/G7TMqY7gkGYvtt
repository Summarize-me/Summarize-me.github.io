i<00:08:49.440><c> think</c><00:08:49.680><c> this</c><00:08:49.920><c> also</c><00:08:50.320><c> comes</c>

00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
i think this also comes
 

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:54.470 align:start position:0%
i think this also comes
from<00:08:51.839><c> historical</c><00:08:52.640><c> context</c><00:08:53.440><c> like</c><00:08:54.000><c> by</c><00:08:54.160><c> that</c><00:08:54.399><c> i</c>

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
from historical context like by that i
 

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.670 align:start position:0%
from historical context like by that i
mean

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
mean
 

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.750 align:start position:0%
mean
i<00:08:55.920><c> still</c><00:08:56.240><c> think</c><00:08:56.399><c> that</c><00:08:56.560><c> most</c><00:08:56.880><c> founders</c><00:08:57.600><c> are</c>

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
i still think that most founders are
 

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.630 align:start position:0%
i still think that most founders are
kind<00:08:57.920><c> of</c>

00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%

and<00:09:12.240><c> so</c><00:09:12.399><c> i</c><00:09:12.480><c> think</c><00:09:12.640><c> what's</c><00:09:12.959><c> so</c><00:09:13.279><c> tricky</c><00:09:13.680><c> is</c><00:09:13.760><c> what</c>

and so i think what's so tricky is what
 

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.750 align:start position:0%
and so i think what's so tricky is what
we're<00:09:14.160><c> basically</c><00:09:14.640><c> saying</c><00:09:14.959><c> is</c><00:09:15.120><c> that</c><00:09:15.279><c> like</c><00:09:15.600><c> all</c>

00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
