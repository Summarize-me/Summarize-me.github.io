to be and then I had a conversation with
our<00:04:50.820><c> and</c><00:04:51.150><c> about</c><00:04:51.480><c> the</c><00:04:51.660><c> series</c><00:04:52.170><c> a</c><00:04:52.320><c> batch</c><00:04:52.530><c> and</c>

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 align:start position:0%
our and about the series a batch and
 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.100 align:start position:0%
our and about the series a batch and
thought<00:04:53.250><c> this</c><00:04:53.700><c> is</c><00:04:53.880><c> probably</c><00:04:54.030><c> a</c><00:04:54.240><c> good</c><00:04:54.390><c> idea</c><00:04:54.750><c> and</c>

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 align:start position:0%
thought this is probably a good idea and
 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
thought this is probably a good idea and
it's<00:04:55.440><c> a</c><00:04:55.530><c> good</c><00:04:55.710><c> good</c><00:04:56.550><c> guide</c><00:04:56.760><c> uh</c><00:04:56.790><c> so</c><00:04:57.360><c> where</c><00:04:57.540><c> to</c><00:04:57.660><c> do</c>

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 align:start position:0%
it's a good good guide uh so where to do
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.690 align:start position:0%
it's a good good guide uh so where to do
that<00:04:57.840><c> so</c><00:04:58.290><c> then</c><00:04:58.470><c> we</c><00:04:58.590><c> joined</c><00:04:59.040><c> the</c><00:04:59.220><c> series</c><00:04:59.460><c> a</c>

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
that so then we joined the series a
 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.110 align:start position:0%
that so then we joined the series a
batch<00:04:59.910><c> in</c><00:05:00.300><c> January</c><00:05:01.200><c> of</c><00:05:01.230><c> this</c><00:05:01.410><c> year</c><00:05:01.490><c> and</c><00:05:02.490><c> that</c>

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
batch in January of this year and that
 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.540 align:start position:0%
batch in January of this year and that
process<00:05:03.870><c> was</c><00:05:04.290><c> about</c><00:05:04.590><c> I</c><00:05:04.920><c> think</c><00:05:05.220><c> it</c><00:05:05.280><c> was</c><00:05:05.400><c> like</c>

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 align:start position:0%
process was about I think it was like
 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.590 align:start position:0%
process was about I think it was like

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:51.500 align:start position:0%
back that up that was significantly more
 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.740 align:start position:0%
back that up that was significantly more
in-depth<00:07:51.979><c> around</c><00:07:52.340><c> the</c><00:07:52.580><c> financials</c><00:07:53.090><c> okay</c><00:07:53.539><c> and</c>

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
maximize for valuation because the thing
 

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.019 align:start position:0%
maximize for valuation because the thing

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:36.029 align:start position:0%
is that if you maximize for valuation
 

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:39.410 align:start position:0%
is that if you maximize for valuation
then<00:15:36.960><c> you</c><00:15:37.920><c> know</c><00:15:38.010><c> it</c><00:15:38.220><c> incentives</c><00:15:39.210><c> aren't</c>

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
then you know it incentives aren't

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
particular was do they really understand
 

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
particular was do they really understand
how<00:18:40.020><c> we're</c><00:18:40.200><c> trying</c><00:18:40.410><c> to</c><00:18:40.530><c> build</c><00:18:40.620><c> the</c><00:18:40.800><c> data</c><00:18:41.010><c> layer</c>

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:41.250 align:start position:0%
how we're trying to build the data layer
 

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.340 align:start position:0%
how we're trying to build the data layer
so<00:18:41.580><c> one</c><00:18:42.150><c> of</c><00:18:42.180><c> the</c><00:18:42.330><c> things</c><00:18:42.510><c> with</c><00:18:42.690><c> Tara</c><00:18:42.930><c> is</c><00:18:43.170><c> that</c>

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:43.350 align:start position:0%
so one of the things with Tara is that
 

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
so one of the things with Tara is that
we<00:18:43.740><c> integrate</c><00:18:44.220><c> with</c><00:18:44.490><c> JIRA</c><00:18:45.450><c> with</c><00:18:45.750><c> github</c><00:18:46.140><c> and</c>

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:46.290 align:start position:0%
we integrate with JIRA with github and
 

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.620 align:start position:0%
we integrate with JIRA with github and
so<00:18:46.380><c> the</c><00:18:46.470><c> idea</c><00:18:46.680><c> is</c><00:18:46.770><c> to</c><00:18:46.800><c> go</c><00:18:46.950><c> from</c><00:18:47.130><c> spec</c><00:18:47.550><c> to</c><00:18:48.120><c> issues</c>

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
so the idea is to go from spec to issues
 

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.970 align:start position:0%
so the idea is to go from spec to issues
or<00:18:48.810><c> your</c><00:18:48.900><c> issue</c><00:18:49.050><c> tracking</c><00:18:49.350><c> software</c><00:18:49.620><c> which</c>

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
or your issue tracking software which
 

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:51.920 align:start position:0%

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:51.930 align:start position:0%
resides in JIRA and then also go all the
 

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
resides in JIRA and then also go all the
way<00:18:51.960><c> to</c><00:18:52.050><c> commit</c><00:18:52.290><c> so</c><00:18:52.680><c> where</c><00:18:53.430><c> your</c><00:18:53.580><c> version</c>

some good advice we got was negotiate a
 

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.490 align:start position:0%
some good advice we got was negotiate a

cap with your law firm to do the eagles
 

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
cap with your law firm to do the eagles
because<00:20:33.220><c> it</c><00:20:33.460><c> will</c><00:20:33.610><c> go</c><00:20:33.760><c> over</c><00:20:34.000><c> and</c><00:20:34.150><c> it</c><00:20:34.210><c> will</c><00:20:34.300><c> end</c>

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.390 align:start position:0%
because it will go over and it will end
 

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
because it will go over and it will end
up<00:20:34.480><c> being</c><00:20:34.540><c> 30</c><00:20:34.900><c> days</c><00:20:35.080><c> or</c><00:20:35.200><c> maybe</c><00:20:35.380><c> even</c><00:20:35.440><c> 60</c><00:20:35.860><c> days</c>

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.010 align:start position:0%
up being 30 days or maybe even 60 days
 

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.250 align:start position:0%
up being 30 days or maybe even 60 days
and<00:20:36.240><c> so</c><00:20:37.240><c> I</c><00:20:37.270><c> think</c><00:20:37.600><c> that</c><00:20:37.780><c> was</c><00:20:37.900><c> a</c><00:20:37.930><c> good</c><00:20:38.110><c> bit</c><00:20:38.230><c> of</c>

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:38.260 align:start position:0%
and so I think that was a good bit of
 

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
and so I think that was a good bit of
advice<00:20:38.560><c> I</c><00:20:38.740><c> think</c><00:20:38.890><c> some</c><00:20:39.070><c> of</c><00:20:39.100><c> the</c><00:20:39.250><c> questions</c>

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:39.550 align:start position:0%

that<00:20:39.610><c> I</c><00:20:39.700><c> asked</c><00:20:40.150><c> the</c><00:20:40.300><c> funds</c><00:20:40.540><c> in</c><00:20:40.810><c> that</c><00:20:41.320><c> in</c><00:20:41.650><c> that</c>

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:41.710 align:start position:0%
that I asked the funds in that in that

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.940 align:start position:0%
early on because we had so much interest
when<00:36:43.910><c> we</c><00:36:44.030><c> started</c><00:36:44.420><c> raising</c><00:36:44.840><c> out</c><00:36:45.290><c> here</c><00:36:45.620><c> like</c>

people when you're raising your series a
 

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:20.420 align:start position:0%
people when you're raising your series a
then<00:42:19.320><c> this</c><00:42:19.770><c> partner's</c><00:42:20.040><c> going</c><00:42:20.160><c> to</c><00:42:20.220><c> become</c><00:42:20.400><c> a</c>

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:20.430 align:start position:0%
then this partner's going to become a
 

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.870 align:start position:0%
then this partner's going to become a
key<00:42:20.760><c> part</c><00:42:21.240><c> of</c><00:42:21.859><c> even</c><00:42:22.859><c> day-to-day</c><00:42:23.310><c> operations</c>

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
key part of even day-to-day operations
 

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.050 align:start position:0%
key part of even day-to-day operations
and<00:42:24.260><c> and</c><00:42:25.260><c> so</c><00:42:25.440><c> I</c><00:42:25.470><c> think</c><00:42:25.589><c> the</c><00:42:26.099><c> you</c><00:42:26.339><c> know</c><00:42:26.369><c> some</c><00:42:26.790><c> I</c>

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
and and so I think the you know some I
 

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
and and so I think the you know some I
would<00:42:27.510><c> say</c><00:42:27.630><c> probably</c><00:42:27.960><c> some</c><00:42:28.619><c> things</c><00:42:28.830><c> that</c>

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
would say probably some things that
 

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:32.180 align:start position:0%
would say probably some things that
founders<00:42:30.230><c> negatively</c><00:42:31.230><c> optimize</c><00:42:31.650><c> for</c><00:42:31.859><c> number</c>

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:32.190 align:start position:0%
founders negatively optimize for number
 

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:33.890 align:start position:0%
founders negatively optimize for number
one<00:42:32.310><c> would</c><00:42:32.460><c> be</c><00:42:32.490><c> valuation</c><00:42:33.089><c> so</c><00:42:33.330><c> I</c><00:42:33.359><c> don't</c>

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
one would be valuation so I don't
 

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.660 align:start position:0%
one would be valuation so I don't
recommend<00:42:34.230><c> optimizing</c><00:42:34.890><c> for</c><00:42:34.980><c> valuation</c><00:42:35.280><c> I</c>

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:35.670 align:start position:0%
recommend optimizing for valuation I
 

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.010 align:start position:0%
recommend optimizing for valuation I
think<00:42:35.910><c> then</c><00:42:36.030><c> you</c><00:42:36.060><c> have</c><00:42:36.300><c> to</c><00:42:36.390><c> work</c><00:42:36.540><c> up</c><00:42:36.750><c> to</c><00:42:36.780><c> that</c>

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
think then you have to work up to that
 

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.470 align:start position:0%
think then you have to work up to that
valuation<00:42:37.380><c> and</c><00:42:37.910><c> and</c><00:42:38.910><c> obviously</c><00:42:39.300><c> you</c><00:42:39.390><c> know</c>

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
valuation and and obviously you know
 

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.050 align:start position:0%
valuation and and obviously you know
we've<00:42:39.599><c> seen</c><00:42:39.630><c> this</c><00:42:40.619><c> nowadays</c><00:42:41.550><c> right</c><00:42:41.730><c> the</c>

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
we've seen this nowadays right the
 

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.430 align:start position:0%
we've seen this nowadays right the

market<00:42:43.859><c> so</c><00:42:44.430><c> I</c><00:42:44.460><c> think</c><00:42:44.660><c> you</c><00:42:45.660><c> know</c><00:42:45.750><c> it's</c><00:42:45.990><c> uh</c><00:42:46.080><c> it's</c>

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
like and really come up with a valuation
 

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
like and really come up with a valuation
that<00:42:51.030><c> is</c><00:42:52.010><c> optimistic</c><00:42:53.010><c> but</c><00:42:53.280><c> realistically</c>

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:54.210 align:start position:0%

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:57.070 align:start position:0%

probably<00:58:56.030><c> raise</c><00:58:56.210><c> another</c><00:58:56.450><c> round</c><00:58:56.690><c> before</c><00:58:56.840><c> we</c>

00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
probably raise another round before we

probably raise another round before we
you<00:58:57.980><c> know</c><00:58:58.100><c> continue</c><00:58:58.640><c> with</c><00:58:58.760><c> that</c><00:58:58.910><c> so</c><00:58:59.390><c> we've</c><00:58:59.660><c> had</c>
