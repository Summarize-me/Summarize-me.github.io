this is the very birth of a company
 

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.330 align:start position:0%
this is the very birth of a company
let's<00:10:02.780><c> go</c><00:10:02.930><c> through</c><00:10:03.230><c> some</c><00:10:03.380><c> of</c><00:10:03.500><c> the</c><00:10:03.560><c> Fage</c><00:10:03.710><c> phases</c>

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:04.340 align:start position:0%
let's go through some of the Fage phases
 

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:07.570 align:start position:0%
let's go through some of the Fage phases
so<00:10:04.660><c> this</c><00:10:05.660><c> is</c><00:10:05.840><c> roughly</c><00:10:06.290><c> all</c><00:10:06.680><c> of</c><00:10:07.010><c> the</c><00:10:07.130><c> phases</c><00:10:07.370><c> of</c>

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:07.580 align:start position:0%
so this is roughly all of the phases of
 

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.150 align:start position:0%
so this is roughly all of the phases of
a<00:10:07.820><c> company</c><00:10:08.180><c> it</c><00:10:08.330><c> starts</c><00:10:08.570><c> with</c><00:10:08.660><c> idea</c><00:10:08.960><c> you</c><00:10:09.920><c> get</c><00:10:10.070><c> to</c>

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
a company it starts with idea you get to
 

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.130 align:start position:0%
a company it starts with idea you get to
prototype<00:10:10.520><c> phase</c><00:10:10.730><c> you</c><00:10:11.570><c> then</c><00:10:11.720><c> get</c><00:10:11.840><c> to</c><00:10:11.900><c> launch</c>

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.140 align:start position:0%
prototype phase you then get to launch
 

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
prototype phase you then get to launch
traction<00:10:13.130><c> monetization</c><00:10:14.120><c> and</c><00:10:14.360><c> growth</c><00:10:14.900><c> I</c><00:10:15.110><c> put</c>

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:15.410 align:start position:0%
traction monetization and growth I put
 

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.290 align:start position:0%
traction monetization and growth I put

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.020 align:start position:0%
monetization after traction because
oftentimes<00:10:17.870><c> that's</c><00:10:18.230><c> the</c><00:10:18.410><c> way</c><00:10:18.530><c> it</c><00:10:18.650><c> goes</c><00:10:19.030><c> and</c>

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.030 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that's the way it goes and
 

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.420 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that's the way it goes and
actually<00:10:20.540><c> getting</c><00:10:21.020><c> going</c><00:10:21.500><c> from</c><00:10:21.830><c> launch</c><00:10:22.130><c> and</c>

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:22.430 align:start position:0%
actually getting going from launch and
 

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.700 align:start position:0%
actually getting going from launch and

are<00:21:54.640><c> basically</c><00:21:54.790><c> three</c><00:21:55.210><c> tools</c><00:21:55.450><c> I</c><00:21:55.540><c> think</c><00:21:55.570><c> these</c>

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:55.810 align:start position:0%
are basically three tools I think these
 

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
are basically three tools I think these
are<00:21:55.870><c> probably</c><00:21:56.290><c> the</c><00:21:56.560><c> only</c><00:21:56.710><c> three</c><00:21:57.010><c> that</c><00:21:57.160><c> you</c>

are probably the only three that you
 

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
are probably the only three that you

need number one customer interviews you
probably<00:22:00.970><c> need</c><00:22:01.120><c> about</c><00:22:01.240><c> five</c><00:22:01.510><c> to</c><00:22:01.750><c> ten</c><00:22:01.900><c> of</c><00:22:01.930><c> these</c>

00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:58.970 align:start position:0%
that because I assumed email password as

00:26:01.629 --> 00:26:01.639 align:start position:0%
a login form obviously so wasn't the

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
signup form as a login form so we added
 

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.409 align:start position:0%
signup form as a login form so we added
a<00:26:03.460><c> gratuitous</c><00:26:04.460><c> field</c><00:26:04.669><c> that</c><00:26:04.850><c> just</c><00:26:05.029><c> says</c><00:26:05.179><c> your</c>

00:26:05.409 --> 00:26:05.419 align:start position:0%
a gratuitous field that just says your
 

00:26:05.419 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
a gratuitous field that just says your

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.090 align:start position:0%

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:31.510 align:start position:0%
I'll take a pause there and that's it so
 

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.270 align:start position:0%
I'll take a pause there and that's it so

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
really two primary qualities number one
 

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.210 align:start position:0%
really two primary qualities number one
is<00:42:16.000><c> they're</c><00:42:16.270><c> optimists</c><00:42:16.750><c> so</c><00:42:17.230><c> they</c><00:42:17.500><c> don't</c><00:42:17.890><c> see</c>

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:18.220 align:start position:0%
is they're optimists so they don't see
 

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.490 align:start position:0%
is they're optimists so they don't see
risks<00:42:18.670><c> where</c><00:42:18.820><c> other</c><00:42:19.000><c> people</c><00:42:19.330><c> see</c><00:42:19.510><c> risks</c><00:42:19.870><c> and</c>

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:20.500 align:start position:0%
risks where other people see risks and
 

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
risks where other people see risks and
number<00:42:20.680><c> two</c><00:42:20.830><c> is</c><00:42:20.890><c> they're</c><00:42:21.040><c> determined</c><00:42:21.400><c> so</c><00:42:21.490><c> I</c>

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
number two is they're determined so I
 

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
number two is they're determined so I
just<00:42:21.700><c> don't</c><00:42:21.850><c> give</c><00:42:21.970><c> up</c><00:42:22.090><c> so</c><00:42:22.810><c> I</c><00:42:22.870><c> think</c><00:42:22.960><c> you</c><00:42:23.110><c> know</c>

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:23.470 align:start position:0%
just don't give up so I think you know
 

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
just don't give up so I think you know
generally<00:42:23.920><c> speaking</c><00:42:23.950><c> those</c><00:42:24.520><c> are</c><00:42:24.670><c> the</c><00:42:24.790><c> two</c>

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:24.910 align:start position:0%
generally speaking those are the two
 

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
generally speaking those are the two
things<00:42:25.120><c> your</c><00:42:26.080><c> company</c><00:42:26.470><c> only</c><00:42:26.760><c> fails</c><00:42:27.760><c> when</c><00:42:28.090><c> you</c>

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:28.210 align:start position:0%
things your company only fails when you
 

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:30.330 align:start position:0%
things your company only fails when you
give<00:42:28.360><c> up</c><00:42:28.560><c> right</c><00:42:29.560><c> and</c><00:42:29.770><c> while</c><00:42:30.040><c> you're</c><00:42:30.190><c> still</c>

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:30.340 align:start position:0%
give up right and while you're still
 

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.950 align:start position:0%
give up right and while you're still
working<00:42:30.520><c> on</c><00:42:30.700><c> a</c><00:42:30.760><c> by</c><00:42:30.970><c> definition</c><00:42:31.360><c> it's</c><00:42:31.780><c> still</c>

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
working on a by definition it's still
 

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
working on a by definition it's still
going<00:42:32.320><c> and</c><00:42:32.440><c> so</c><00:42:32.560><c> I</c><00:42:32.590><c> think</c><00:42:32.920><c> I</c><00:42:33.700><c> think</c><00:42:34.120><c> having</c><00:42:34.330><c> that</c>

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:34.450 align:start position:0%
going and so I think I think having that
 

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.510 align:start position:0%
going and so I think I think having that

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:45.970 align:start position:0%
work out but but but I think just
 

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.910 align:start position:0%
work out but but but I think just
continue<00:42:46.420><c> to</c><00:42:46.450><c> be</c><00:42:46.570><c> determined</c><00:42:47.080><c> and</c><00:42:47.260><c> knowing</c>

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:34.300 align:start position:0%
the the the sad answer is we were not

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
them that's probably why it took us 18
 

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.250 align:start position:0%
them that's probably why it took us 18

just the the word discontinuous
 

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:09.970 align:start position:0%
just the the word discontinuous
improvement<00:51:09.080><c> and</c><00:51:09.140><c> like</c><00:51:09.290><c> what</c><00:51:09.440><c> does</c><00:51:09.530><c> that</c><00:51:09.560><c> mean</c>

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:09.980 align:start position:0%
improvement and like what does that mean
 

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.620 align:start position:0%
improvement and like what does that mean
and<00:51:10.730><c> a</c><00:51:10.940><c> lot</c><00:51:11.120><c> of</c><00:51:11.150><c> the</c><00:51:11.240><c> writings</c><00:51:11.450><c> about</c>

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:13.180 align:start position:0%
continuous improvement I think
 

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
continuous improvement I think
discontinuous<00:51:14.180><c> improvement</c><00:51:14.630><c> is</c><00:51:14.720><c> is</c>

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:15.070 align:start position:0%
discontinuous improvement is is
 

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:17.710 align:start position:0%
discontinuous improvement is is
effectively<00:51:16.090><c> when</c><00:51:17.090><c> you're</c><00:51:17.210><c> making</c><00:51:17.420><c> a</c><00:51:17.480><c> big</c>

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
effectively when you're making a big
 

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.050 align:start position:0%
effectively when you're making a big

00:51:20.050 --> 00:51:20.060 align:start position:0%
leap not and and sometimes small
 

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.790 align:start position:0%

incremental<00:51:20.810><c> improvements</c><00:51:21.290><c> don't</c><00:51:21.470><c> get</c><00:51:21.680><c> you</c>

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
incremental improvements don't get you
 

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.380 align:start position:0%
incremental improvements don't get you
to<00:51:21.950><c> that</c><00:51:22.130><c> big</c><00:51:22.340><c> leap</c><00:51:22.550><c> right</c><00:51:22.940><c> and</c><00:51:23.150><c> so</c><00:51:23.240><c> I</c><00:51:23.270><c> think</c>

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:23.390 align:start position:0%
to that big leap right and so I think
 

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.150 align:start position:0%
to that big leap right and so I think
you<00:51:23.930><c> know</c><00:51:24.020><c> imagine</c><00:51:24.470><c> yourself</c><00:51:24.740><c> starting</c><00:51:25.070><c> with</c>

00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:29.810 align:start position:0%
make continuous improvement right like
 

00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:31.150 align:start position:0%
make continuous improvement right like

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:51.230 align:start position:0%

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.140 align:start position:0%

the<00:51:51.620><c> same</c><00:51:51.770><c> way</c><00:51:51.830><c> as</c><00:51:52.130><c> taking</c><00:51:52.460><c> small</c><00:51:52.700><c> steps</c><00:51:52.820><c> and</c>

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:53.150 align:start position:0%
the same way as taking small steps and
 

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.930 align:start position:0%
the same way as taking small steps and

you<00:56:09.990><c> launch</c><00:56:10.260><c> that</c><00:56:10.380><c> then</c><00:56:11.070><c> they're</c><00:56:11.220><c> gonna</c><00:56:11.310><c> be</c>
