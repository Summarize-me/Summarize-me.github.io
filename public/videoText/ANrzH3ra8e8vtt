we
 

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.010 align:start position:0%
we

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.409 align:start position:0%
coaster and this was you know the part
where<00:19:37.260><c> we</c><00:19:37.620><c> had</c><00:19:38.520><c> a</c><00:19:38.760><c> really</c><00:19:38.820><c> difficult</c><00:19:39.120><c> decision</c>

00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:39.419 align:start position:0%
where we had a really difficult decision
 

00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:43.789 align:start position:0%
where we had a really difficult decision
to<00:19:39.660><c> make</c><00:19:39.799><c> and</c><00:19:40.799><c> that</c><00:19:41.460><c> decision</c><00:19:41.820><c> was</c><00:19:42.240><c> can</c><00:19:43.080><c> abdeco</c>

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
to make and that decision was can abdeco
 

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:45.950 align:start position:0%
to make and that decision was can abdeco
stand<00:19:44.220><c> on</c><00:19:44.520><c> its</c><00:19:44.820><c> own</c><00:19:44.880><c> two</c><00:19:45.059><c> feet</c>

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%

without having the crutch of VC funding
 

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:51.350 align:start position:0%
without having the crutch of VC funding
so<00:19:49.980><c> that</c><00:19:50.160><c> means</c><00:19:50.460><c> that</c><00:19:50.700><c> we</c><00:19:50.940><c> have</c><00:19:51.059><c> to</c><00:19:51.179><c> take</c><00:19:51.299><c> a</c>

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
so that means that we have to take a
 

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.130 align:start position:0%
so that means that we have to take a

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
look in the mirror we're actually
 

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.930 align:start position:0%
look in the mirror we're actually
building<00:19:52.440><c> a</c><00:19:52.620><c> real</c><00:19:52.740><c> business</c><00:19:52.980><c> building</c><00:19:53.580><c> a</c><00:19:53.820><c> real</c>

so<00:19:55.679><c> we</c><00:19:56.039><c> cut</c><00:19:56.220><c> our</c><00:19:56.460><c> marketing</c><00:19:56.880><c> to</c><00:19:57.120><c> zero</c><00:19:57.539><c> dollars</c>

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
so we cut our marketing to zero dollars
 

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.150 align:start position:0%
so we cut our marketing to zero dollars

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
customer acquisition cost where I mean
 

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.390 align:start position:0%
customer acquisition cost where I mean
at<00:20:21.780><c> that</c><00:20:21.900><c> point</c><00:20:22.020><c> there</c><00:20:22.440><c> were</c><00:20:22.559><c> zero</c><00:20:22.919><c> but</c><00:20:23.160><c> they</c>

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
at that point there were zero but they
 

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.730 align:start position:0%
at that point there were zero but they
were<00:20:23.580><c> profitable</c><00:20:24.000><c> as</c><00:20:24.360><c> well</c><00:20:24.539><c> right</c>

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
were profitable as well right
 

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.190 align:start position:0%
were profitable as well right
so<00:20:26.400><c> this</c><00:20:26.700><c> was</c><00:20:26.820><c> a</c><00:20:27.120><c> really</c><00:20:27.240><c> tough</c><00:20:27.539><c> decision</c><00:20:27.840><c> and</c>

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
so this was a really tough decision and
 

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.930 align:start position:0%
so this was a really tough decision and
we<00:20:28.380><c> had</c><00:20:28.440><c> to</c><00:20:28.559><c> raise</c><00:20:28.740><c> prices</c><00:20:28.980><c> on</c><00:20:29.280><c> customers</c><00:20:29.700><c> as</c>

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
we had to raise prices on customers as
 

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.270 align:start position:0%
we had to raise prices on customers as
well<00:20:30.120><c> in</c><00:20:30.960><c> areas</c><00:20:31.320><c> where</c><00:20:31.559><c> we</c><00:20:31.740><c> were</c><00:20:31.860><c> offering</c>

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
well in areas where we were offering
 

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.070 align:start position:0%
well in areas where we were offering
something<00:20:32.460><c> at</c><00:20:32.760><c> a</c><00:20:32.880><c> price</c><00:20:33.000><c> that</c><00:20:33.299><c> was</c><00:20:33.480><c> just</c><00:20:33.720><c> not</c>

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
something at a price that was just not
 

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.370 align:start position:0%
something at a price that was just not

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
feasible and not realistic and so that
 

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.990 align:start position:0%
feasible and not realistic and so that
is<00:20:37.559><c> if</c><00:20:37.860><c> you</c><00:20:38.039><c> have</c><00:20:38.160><c> to</c><00:20:38.280><c> make</c><00:20:38.460><c> these</c><00:20:38.700><c> decisions</c>

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
