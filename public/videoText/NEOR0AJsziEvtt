they've got 20 other job offers right
 

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.670 align:start position:0%
they've got 20 other job offers right
and<00:12:40.079><c> so</c><00:12:40.360><c> why</c><00:12:40.480><c> is</c><00:12:40.680><c> your</c><00:12:40.959><c> pitch</c><00:12:41.240><c> going</c><00:12:41.320><c> to</c><00:12:41.440><c> be</c><00:12:41.560><c> so</c>

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
and so why is your pitch going to be so
 

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.350 align:start position:0%
and so why is your pitch going to be so
much<00:12:41.839><c> better</c><00:12:42.079><c> than</c><00:12:42.199><c> the</c><00:12:42.320><c> other</c><00:12:42.480><c> 20</c><00:12:42.720><c> startups</c>

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
much better than the other 20 startups
 

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.509 align:start position:0%
much better than the other 20 startups
right<00:12:44.079><c> um</c><00:12:44.240><c> and</c><00:12:44.360><c> so</c><00:12:44.560><c> again</c><00:12:44.720><c> I</c><00:12:44.880><c> just</c><00:12:45.040><c> I</c><00:12:45.120><c> view</c><00:12:45.399><c> that</c>

00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
right um and so again I just I view that
 

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:46.949 align:start position:0%
right um and so again I just I view that
as<00:12:45.639><c> like</c><00:12:45.800><c> that's</c><00:12:45.920><c> the</c><00:12:46.079><c> second</c><00:12:46.360><c> big</c><00:12:46.519><c> test</c><00:12:46.839><c> which</c>

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
as like that's the second big test which
 

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:49.189 align:start position:0%
as like that's the second big test which
is<00:12:47.120><c> can</c><00:12:47.240><c> you</c><00:12:47.440><c> successfully</c><00:12:48.000><c> execute</c><00:12:48.959><c> uh</c><00:12:49.079><c> a</c>

00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
is can you successfully execute uh a
 

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:52.230 align:start position:0%
is can you successfully execute uh a
formal<00:12:49.600><c> pitch</c><00:12:50.240><c> um</c><00:12:51.160><c> and</c><00:12:51.320><c> then</c><00:12:51.560><c> if</c><00:12:51.760><c> that</c><00:12:51.920><c> goes</c>

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
formal pitch um and then if that goes
 

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.350 align:start position:0%
formal pitch um and then if that goes
well<00:12:52.920><c> then</c><00:12:53.079><c> generally</c><00:12:53.399><c> you</c><00:12:53.519><c> go</c><00:12:53.680><c> into</c><00:12:54.199><c> um</c><00:12:54.279><c> you</c>

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
well then generally you go into um you
 

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.069 align:start position:0%
well then generally you go into um you
know<00:12:54.519><c> there's</c><00:12:54.839><c> there</c><00:12:55.320><c> if</c><00:12:55.399><c> it's</c><00:12:55.600><c> like</c><00:12:55.800><c> super</c>

00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:54.519 align:start position:0%
back to this concept of the tests like
 

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:56.150 align:start position:0%
back to this concept of the tests like
it's<00:13:54.720><c> not</c><00:13:55.000><c> that</c><00:13:55.160><c> hard</c><00:13:55.320><c> to</c><00:13:55.480><c> get</c><00:13:55.639><c> good</c><00:13:55.800><c> at</c><00:13:55.959><c> this</c>

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's not that hard to get good at this
 

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.069 align:start position:0%
it's not that hard to get good at this
part<00:13:56.639><c> like</c><00:13:57.120><c> and</c><00:13:57.199><c> so</c><00:13:57.399><c> I</c><00:13:57.519><c> just</c><00:13:57.680><c> I</c><00:13:57.759><c> think</c><00:13:57.920><c> it's</c>

00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
part like and so I just I think it's
 

00:13:58.079 --> 00:13:59.629 align:start position:0%
part like and so I just I think it's
worth<00:13:58.279><c> the</c><00:13:58.399><c> time</c><00:13:58.560><c> to</c><00:13:58.880><c> really</c><00:13:59.279><c> understand</c><00:13:59.440><c> and</c>

00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
worth the time to really understand and
 

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:01.269 align:start position:0%
worth the time to really understand and
get<00:13:59.839><c> good</c><00:14:00.000><c> at</c><00:14:00.160><c> how</c><00:14:00.320><c> to</c><00:14:00.639><c> how</c><00:14:00.759><c> to</c><00:14:00.920><c> how</c><00:14:01.000><c> to</c><00:14:01.120><c> get</c>

from<00:22:09.799><c> history</c><00:22:10.039><c> is</c><00:22:10.120><c> like</c><00:22:10.240><c> it's</c><00:22:10.400><c> always</c><00:22:10.679><c> hard</c><00:22:11.480><c> um</c>

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
from history is like it's always hard um
 

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.230 align:start position:0%
from history is like it's always hard um
and<00:22:11.840><c> so</c><00:22:12.000><c> you</c><00:22:12.120><c> just</c><00:22:12.279><c> like</c><00:22:12.600><c> Henry</c><00:22:12.799><c> Ford</c><00:22:13.039><c> is</c><00:22:13.120><c> an</c>

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
and so you just like Henry Ford is an
 

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.470 align:start position:0%
and so you just like Henry Ford is an

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
that that would be a relatively easy
 

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.909 align:start position:0%
that that would be a relatively easy

thing to get people to want um and it
 

00:22:24.919 --> 00:22:26.029 align:start position:0%
thing to get people to want um and it
turns<00:22:25.120><c> out</c><00:22:25.279><c> there</c><00:22:25.400><c> was</c><00:22:25.559><c> actually</c><00:22:25.720><c> a</c><00:22:25.799><c> lot</c><00:22:25.919><c> of</c>

00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
turns out there was actually a lot of
 

00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:27.070 align:start position:0%
turns out there was actually a lot of
effort<00:22:26.240><c> and</c><00:22:26.360><c> work</c><00:22:26.520><c> involved</c><00:22:26.799><c> in</c><00:22:26.880><c> getting</c>

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
people to think that was a good idea
 

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.269 align:start position:0%
people to think that was a good idea
um<00:22:29.600><c> and</c><00:22:29.840><c> so</c><00:22:30.400><c> um</c><00:22:31.320><c> uh</c><00:22:32.039><c> it's</c><00:22:32.240><c> just</c><00:22:32.440><c> it's</c><00:22:32.720><c> it's</c><00:22:33.159><c> it's</c>

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
um and so um uh it's just it's it's it's
 

00:22:33.279 --> 00:22:34.909 align:start position:0%
um and so um uh it's just it's it's it's
so<00:22:33.559><c> it's</c><00:22:33.720><c> that</c><00:22:33.880><c> goes</c><00:22:34.080><c> back</c><00:22:34.200><c> to</c><00:22:34.320><c> Ben's</c><00:22:34.600><c> idea</c><00:22:34.840><c> of</c>

00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
so it's that goes back to Ben's idea of
 

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:36.430 align:start position:0%
so it's that goes back to Ben's idea of
the<00:22:35.000><c> struggle</c><00:22:35.440><c> it's</c><00:22:35.600><c> just</c><00:22:35.760><c> there</c><00:22:36.000><c> is</c><00:22:36.159><c> so</c><00:22:36.279><c> much</c>

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
work and effort involved there are so
 

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.990 align:start position:0%
work and effort involved there are so
