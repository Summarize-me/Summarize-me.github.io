00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
what would it take to fix it and sure
 

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.190 align:start position:0%
what would it take to fix it and sure
this<00:08:55.600><c> is</c><00:08:55.720><c> one</c><00:08:55.880><c> of</c><00:08:56.000><c> the</c><00:08:56.240><c> most</c><00:08:56.600><c> crowded</c>

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
