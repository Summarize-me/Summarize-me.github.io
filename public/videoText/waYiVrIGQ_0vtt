if you're one of the lucky people that

have a relatively easy time fundraising
 

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
have a relatively easy time fundraising
so<00:12:52.320><c> also</c><00:12:52.830><c> think</c><00:12:53.190><c> about</c><00:12:53.340><c> how</c><00:12:53.910><c> much</c><00:12:54.240><c> money</c><00:12:54.420><c> do</c>

so also think about how much money do
 

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.420 align:start position:0%
so also think about how much money do
you<00:12:54.660><c> actually</c><00:12:54.840><c> need</c><00:12:55.260><c> to</c><00:12:55.470><c> get</c><00:12:55.680><c> to</c><00:12:55.950><c> that</c><00:12:56.070><c> next</c>

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:56.430 align:start position:0%
you actually need to get to that next
 

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.460 align:start position:0%
you actually need to get to that next

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:58.470 align:start position:0%

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.050 align:start position:0%
milestone because when you get to that
next<00:12:58.770><c> milestone</c><00:12:59.280><c> and</c><00:12:59.550><c> you're</c><00:12:59.640><c> raising</c><00:12:59.820><c> the</c>

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%

next amounts of money it's going to be

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:05.550 align:start position:0%
as a higher valuation in theory and so
 

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.910 align:start position:0%
as a higher valuation in theory and so
you<00:13:06.000><c> know</c><00:13:06.120><c> the</c><00:13:06.330><c> dilution</c><00:13:07.110><c> that</c><00:13:07.140><c> you're</c><00:13:07.470><c> taking</c>

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:10.230 align:start position:0%
as a as a founder will be less because
 

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
as a as a founder will be less because
the<00:13:10.620><c> the</c><00:13:10.830><c> invest</c><00:13:11.100><c> is</c><00:13:11.220><c> putting</c><00:13:11.520><c> money</c><00:13:11.670><c> and</c><00:13:11.880><c> it's</c>

the the invest is putting money and it's

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
a higher valuation whereas if you raise
 

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
a higher valuation whereas if you raise
a<00:13:14.340><c> bunch</c><00:13:14.670><c> of</c><00:13:14.820><c> money</c><00:13:14.880><c> really</c><00:13:15.270><c> early</c><00:13:15.660><c> on</c><00:13:15.690><c> that's</c>

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.170 align:start position:0%
a bunch of money really early on that's
 

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.750 align:start position:0%
a bunch of money really early on that's
likely<00:13:16.470><c> to</c><00:13:16.590><c> be</c><00:13:16.770><c> at</c><00:13:16.860><c> a</c><00:13:16.890><c> much</c><00:13:17.070><c> lower</c><00:13:17.370><c> valuation</c>

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
likely to be at a much lower valuation
 

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.430 align:start position:0%

so<00:13:18.630><c> more</c><00:13:18.840><c> dilution</c><00:13:19.380><c> to</c><00:13:19.530><c> you</c><00:13:19.680><c> as</c><00:13:19.800><c> a</c><00:13:19.830><c> founder</c><00:13:21.440><c> so</c>

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
so more dilution to you as a founder so
 

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
so more dilution to you as a founder so

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:13.410 align:start position:0%
five orders we are onto something so the

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:17.730 align:start position:0%
something
 

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
something
and<00:14:17.910><c> then</c><00:14:18.510><c> the</c><00:14:18.690><c> next</c><00:14:18.900><c> seed</c><00:14:19.230><c> is</c><00:14:19.620><c> about</c><00:14:20.160><c> like</c>

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:20.490 align:start position:0%
and then the next seed is about like
 

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.660 align:start position:0%
and then the next seed is about like

we<00:14:24.090><c> usually</c><00:14:24.750><c> kind</c><00:14:25.080><c> of</c><00:14:25.230><c> ask</c><00:14:25.470><c> you</c><00:14:25.680><c> well</c><00:14:26.040><c> we</c>

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
we usually kind of ask you well we
 

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
we usually kind of ask you well we
usually<00:14:26.280><c> kind</c><00:14:26.580><c> of</c><00:14:26.640><c> push</c><00:14:26.880><c> you</c><00:14:27.090><c> to</c><00:14:27.210><c> say</c><00:14:27.360><c> if</c>

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:27.570 align:start position:0%
usually kind of push you to say if
 

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.540 align:start position:0%
usually kind of push you to say if
you're<00:14:27.750><c> growing</c><00:14:27.960><c> 10%</c><00:14:28.320><c> week</c><00:14:28.890><c> over</c><00:14:29.130><c> week</c><00:14:29.160><c> that's</c>

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:29.550 align:start position:0%
you're growing 10% week over week that's
 

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.090 align:start position:0%
you're growing 10% week over week that's
really<00:14:30.060><c> good</c><00:14:30.270><c> because</c><00:14:30.930><c> that</c><00:14:31.110><c> means</c><00:14:31.260><c> that</c><00:14:31.770><c> you</c>

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
really good because that means that you
 

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.380 align:start position:0%
really good because that means that you
know<00:14:32.220><c> you</c><00:14:32.280><c> have</c><00:14:32.550><c> the</c><00:14:32.700><c> traction</c><00:14:33.090><c> and</c><00:14:33.210><c> then</c>

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:33.390 align:start position:0%
know you have the traction and then
 

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.300 align:start position:0%
know you have the traction and then

well<00:16:12.570><c> I</c><00:16:12.600><c> think</c><00:16:12.720><c> you</c><00:16:12.870><c> could</c><00:16:13.020><c> launch</c><00:16:13.170><c> as</c><00:16:13.350><c> soon</c><00:16:13.500><c> as</c>

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:13.590 align:start position:0%

so<00:16:33.090><c> I'm</c><00:16:33.210><c> a</c><00:16:33.240><c> huge</c><00:16:33.570><c> fan</c><00:16:33.840><c> of</c><00:16:33.870><c> trying</c><00:16:34.200><c> to</c><00:16:34.350><c> launch</c><00:16:34.500><c> as</c>

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:34.770 align:start position:0%
so I'm a huge fan of trying to launch as
 

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
so I'm a huge fan of trying to launch as

build there's certain things you can do
 

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.190 align:start position:0%
build there's certain things you can do
even<00:16:41.010><c> before</c><00:16:41.340><c> that</c><00:16:41.600><c> you</c><00:16:42.600><c> can</c><00:16:42.720><c> start</c><00:16:42.930><c> talking</c>

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
even before that you can start talking

to your customers you can start building
 

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.900 align:start position:0%
to your customers you can start building
a<00:16:46.260><c> wait</c><00:16:46.470><c> list</c><00:16:46.500><c> of</c><00:16:46.980><c> things</c><00:16:47.250><c> you</c><00:16:47.520><c> can</c><00:16:47.670><c> start</c>

a wait list of things you can start
 

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.310 align:start position:0%
a wait list of things you can start

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
doing there's there's always things you
 

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.590 align:start position:0%
doing there's there's always things you
can<00:16:49.560><c> be</c><00:16:49.770><c> doing</c><00:16:49.980><c> but</c><00:16:50.940><c> the</c><00:16:51.060><c> most</c><00:16:51.210><c> important</c>

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
can be doing but the most important
 

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
can be doing but the most important
thing<00:16:51.690><c> is</c><00:16:51.810><c> to</c><00:16:51.930><c> launch</c><00:16:52.170><c> as</c><00:16:52.410><c> early</c><00:16:53.040><c> and</c><00:16:53.250><c> as</c><00:16:53.490><c> often</c>

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:53.930 align:start position:0%
thing is to launch as early and as often
 

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
thing is to launch as early and as often
yeah<00:16:54.930><c> there's</c><00:16:55.230><c> two</c><00:16:55.440><c> ways</c><00:16:55.710><c> to</c><00:16:55.830><c> think</c><00:16:55.860><c> about</c>

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.010 align:start position:0%
yeah there's two ways to think about
 

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
yeah there's two ways to think about
this<00:16:56.250><c> one</c><00:16:56.550><c> is</c><00:16:57.020><c> if</c><00:16:58.020><c> you</c><00:16:58.400><c> if</c><00:16:59.400><c> if</c><00:16:59.850><c> you</c><00:17:00.060><c> don't</c><00:17:00.570><c> watch</c>

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:00.810 align:start position:0%
this one is if you if if you don't watch
 

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:01.970 align:start position:0%
this one is if you if if you don't watch
then<00:17:01.110><c> you</c><00:17:01.230><c> don't</c><00:17:01.380><c> know</c><00:17:01.590><c> if</c><00:17:01.620><c> you</c><00:17:01.860><c> have</c><00:17:01.950><c> a</c>

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
then you don't know if you have a
 

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.950 align:start position:0%
then you don't know if you have a
product<00:17:02.220><c> anyone</c><00:17:02.550><c> wants</c><00:17:02.940><c> and</c><00:17:03.090><c> why</c><00:17:03.240><c> I</c><00:17:03.540><c> raise</c>

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
product anyone wants and why I raise
 

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
product anyone wants and why I raise
money<00:17:04.200><c> for</c><00:17:04.440><c> that</c><00:17:04.500><c> like</c>

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:05.110 align:start position:0%
money for that like
 

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.809 align:start position:0%
money for that like
where's<00:17:05.319><c> the</c><00:17:05.589><c> confidence</c><00:17:06.069><c> in</c><00:17:06.220><c> that</c><00:17:06.370><c> like</c><00:17:06.579><c> get</c>

00:17:06.809 --> 00:17:06.819 align:start position:0%
where's the confidence in that like get
 

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:08.189 align:start position:0%
where's the confidence in that like get
some<00:17:06.939><c> come</c><00:17:07.120><c> if</c><00:17:07.240><c> you</c><00:17:07.390><c> launched</c><00:17:08.019><c> and</c><00:17:08.110><c> you'll</c>

00:17:08.189 --> 00:17:08.199 align:start position:0%
some come if you launched and you'll
 

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:10.409 align:start position:0%
some come if you launched and you'll
have<00:17:08.380><c> some</c><00:17:08.559><c> confidence</c><00:17:08.919><c> around</c><00:17:09.100><c> that</c><00:17:09.429><c> and</c>

00:17:10.409 --> 00:17:10.419 align:start position:0%
have some confidence around that and
 

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:12.689 align:start position:0%
have some confidence around that and
also<00:17:10.679><c> there's</c><00:17:11.679><c> a</c><00:17:11.919><c> big</c><00:17:12.220><c> difference</c><00:17:12.399><c> in</c><00:17:12.640><c> terms</c>

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:12.699 align:start position:0%
also there's a big difference in terms
 

00:17:12.699 --> 00:17:14.429 align:start position:0%
also there's a big difference in terms
of<00:17:13.000><c> how</c><00:17:13.179><c> much</c><00:17:13.299><c> you</c><00:17:13.360><c> can</c><00:17:13.569><c> raise</c><00:17:13.779><c> an</c><00:17:13.959><c> evaluation</c>

00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
of how much you can raise an evaluation
 

00:17:14.439 --> 00:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
of how much you can raise an evaluation
you<00:17:14.620><c> can</c><00:17:14.799><c> get</c><00:17:15.100><c> if</c><00:17:15.339><c> you</c><00:17:15.789><c> have</c><00:17:16.569><c> users</c><00:17:17.110><c> and</c>

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:17.350 align:start position:0%
you can get if you have users and
 

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:18.539 align:start position:0%
you can get if you have users and
revenue<00:17:17.709><c> versus</c><00:17:18.220><c> you</c><00:17:18.309><c> if</c><00:17:18.399><c> you</c><00:17:18.459><c> have</c>

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:18.549 align:start position:0%
revenue versus you if you have
 

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
revenue versus you if you have
absolutely<00:17:19.089><c> nothing</c><00:17:19.480><c> and</c><00:17:20.409><c> so</c><00:17:20.890><c> I</c><00:17:21.250><c> think</c><00:17:21.610><c> launch</c>

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:22.089 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing and so I think launch
 

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing and so I think launch
now<00:17:22.390><c> even</c><00:17:23.319><c> if</c><00:17:23.439><c> you're</c><00:17:23.589><c> an</c><00:17:23.679><c> engineer</c><00:17:24.179><c> like</c><00:17:25.179><c> if</c>

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:25.449 align:start position:0%
now even if you're an engineer like if

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:21.230 align:start position:0%
what it is that is not scaling and also
