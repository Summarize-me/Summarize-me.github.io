00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:13.430 align:start position:0%
like emotion it can be an incredibly
 

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.060 align:start position:0%
like emotion it can be an incredibly
powerful<00:14:13.970><c> and</c><00:14:14.150><c> good</c><00:14:14.780><c> thing</c><00:14:15.050><c> so</c><00:14:15.440><c> open-ended</c>

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:16.070 align:start position:0%
powerful and good thing so open-ended
 

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:35.860 align:start position:0%
powerful and good thing so open-ended
questions<00:14:16.580><c> and</c><00:14:16.790><c> look</c><00:14:16.910><c> for</c><00:14:17.090><c> emotion</c><00:14:17.980><c> yes</c><00:14:34.870><c> yeah</c>

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:37.850 align:start position:0%
so first question is about prototyping
 

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:46.180 align:start position:0%
so first question is about prototyping
and<00:14:43.090><c> you</c><00:14:44.090><c> know</c><00:14:44.180><c> the</c><00:14:44.330><c> I</c><00:14:44.630><c> have</c><00:14:45.470><c> a</c><00:14:45.500><c> confession</c><00:14:45.920><c> to</c>

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:49.390 align:start position:0%
I have not done a lot of prototyping
 

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.180 align:start position:0%
I have not done a lot of prototyping
simply<00:14:50.390><c> because</c><00:14:50.690><c> I</c><00:14:50.900><c> am</c><00:14:51.170><c> I'm</c><00:14:51.380><c> always</c><00:14:51.650><c> in</c><00:14:51.950><c> such</c><00:14:52.160><c> a</c>
