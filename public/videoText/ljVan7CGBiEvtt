up<00:02:04.020><c> investing</c><00:02:04.439><c> and</c><00:02:04.799><c> it</c><00:02:05.460><c> was</c><00:02:05.700><c> just</c><00:02:05.880><c> a</c><00:02:06.180><c> bizarre</c>

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
up investing and it was just a bizarre
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.029 align:start position:0%
up investing and it was just a bizarre

so<00:02:08.399><c> that</c><00:02:08.520><c> was</c><00:02:08.640><c> probably</c><00:02:08.819><c> the</c><00:02:09.060><c> worst</c><00:02:09.239><c> do</c><00:02:09.479><c> you</c>

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
so that was probably the worst do you
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 align:start position:0%
so that was probably the worst do you
think<00:02:09.899><c> he</c><00:02:10.259><c> remembers</c><00:02:10.800><c> that</c>

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:start position:0%

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
I think that is not the only time he has
 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.790 align:start position:0%
I think that is not the only time he has
done<00:02:15.000><c> it</c><00:02:15.180><c> and</c><00:02:15.540><c> so</c><00:02:15.780><c> so</c><00:02:16.080><c> for</c><00:02:16.260><c> him</c><00:02:16.379><c> this</c><00:02:16.560><c> is</c><00:02:16.680><c> a</c>

and<00:04:48.000><c> so</c><00:04:48.419><c> uh</c><00:04:49.020><c> and</c><00:04:49.380><c> it</c><00:04:49.500><c> turns</c><00:04:49.680><c> out</c><00:04:49.740><c> that</c><00:04:49.919><c> was</c>

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
and so uh and it turns out that was
 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.310 align:start position:0%
and so uh and it turns out that was
great<00:04:50.220><c> no</c><00:04:50.759><c> they</c><00:04:51.060><c> did</c><00:04:51.180><c> not</c><00:04:51.300><c> invest</c><00:04:51.600><c> that</c><00:04:52.139><c> was</c>
