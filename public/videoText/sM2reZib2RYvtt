that<00:12:11.920><c> equity</c><00:12:12.240><c> is</c><00:12:12.399><c> vesting</c><00:12:13.279><c> over</c><00:12:13.519><c> four</c><00:12:13.760><c> years</c>

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
that equity is vesting over four years
 

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:15.750 align:start position:0%
that equity is vesting over four years
right<00:12:14.480><c> like</c><00:12:14.720><c> you</c><00:12:14.800><c> know</c><00:12:15.279><c> you're</c><00:12:15.519><c> in</c><00:12:15.600><c> that</c>

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
right like you know you're in that
 

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.190 align:start position:0%
right like you know you're in that
equity<00:12:16.000><c> a</c><00:12:16.000><c> little</c><00:12:16.160><c> bit</c><00:12:16.320><c> of</c><00:12:16.399><c> time</c><00:12:16.720><c> over</c><00:12:16.959><c> four</c>

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
equity a little bit of time over four
 

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
equity a little bit of time over four
years

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
years
 

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.590 align:start position:0%
years
so<00:12:18.160><c> that's</c><00:12:18.399><c> the</c><00:12:18.639><c> first</c><00:12:18.880><c> part</c><00:12:19.040><c> of</c><00:12:19.120><c> the</c><00:12:19.279><c> trap</c>

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the first part of the trap
 

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.629 align:start position:0%
so that's the first part of the trap
right<00:12:19.760><c> it's</c><00:12:19.920><c> like</c><00:12:20.079><c> if</c><00:12:20.240><c> you</c><00:12:20.560><c> if</c><00:12:20.720><c> you</c><00:12:20.880><c> leave</c>

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
right it's like if you if you leave
 

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:25.350 align:start position:0%
right it's like if you if you leave
you<00:12:22.800><c> say</c><00:12:22.959><c> goodbye</c><00:12:23.279><c> to</c><00:12:23.440><c> that</c><00:12:23.600><c> money</c>

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
you say goodbye to that money
 

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.030 align:start position:0%
you say goodbye to that money
the<00:12:25.600><c> second</c><00:12:25.920><c> part</c><00:12:26.079><c> of</c><00:12:26.160><c> the</c><00:12:26.320><c> trap</c><00:12:26.639><c> is</c><00:12:26.800><c> that</c><00:12:26.959><c> if</c>

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
the second part of the trap is that if
 

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.949 align:start position:0%
the second part of the trap is that if
you're<00:12:27.279><c> good</c><00:12:27.680><c> six</c><00:12:27.920><c> months</c><00:12:28.240><c> in</c>

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
you're good six months in
 

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:30.629 align:start position:0%
you're good six months in
you<00:12:29.120><c> get</c><00:12:29.279><c> another</c>

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
you get another
 

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:32.629 align:start position:0%
you get another
chunk<00:12:30.880><c> of</c><00:12:31.040><c> equity</c><00:12:31.680><c> but</c><00:12:31.839><c> it's</c><00:12:32.000><c> vesting</c><00:12:32.399><c> over</c>

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
chunk of equity but it's vesting over
 

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:34.069 align:start position:0%
chunk of equity but it's vesting over
four<00:12:32.880><c> years</c>

00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
four years
 

00:12:34.079 --> 00:12:35.750 align:start position:0%
four years
so<00:12:34.320><c> think</c><00:12:34.560><c> about</c><00:12:34.720><c> it</c><00:12:34.959><c> you've</c><00:12:35.120><c> been</c><00:12:35.360><c> there</c><00:12:35.519><c> for</c>

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
so think about it you've been there for
 

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.110 align:start position:0%
so think about it you've been there for
six<00:12:36.079><c> months</c><00:12:36.399><c> but</c><00:12:36.560><c> there's</c>

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
six months but there's
 

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.430 align:start position:0%
six months but there's
disproportionately<00:12:38.079><c> more</c><00:12:38.480><c> money</c>

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
disproportionately more money
 

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.509 align:start position:0%
disproportionately more money
that<00:12:39.600><c> you</c><00:12:39.760><c> have</c><00:12:40.000><c> invested</c><00:12:40.560><c> yet</c><00:12:41.200><c> which</c>

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
that you have invested yet which
 

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:42.949 align:start position:0%
that you have invested yet which
incentivize<00:12:42.079><c> you</c><00:12:42.240><c> to</c><00:12:42.399><c> stay</c><00:12:42.560><c> a</c><00:12:42.639><c> little</c><00:12:42.800><c> bit</c>

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
incentivize you to stay a little bit
 

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
incentivize you to stay a little bit

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:47.920 align:start position:0%

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
thinking about one is
 

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.830 align:start position:0%
thinking about one is
how<00:17:54.000><c> long</c><00:17:54.240><c> you're</c><00:17:54.320><c> going</c><00:17:54.480><c> to</c><00:17:54.559><c> stay</c>

00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
right like how can you stay
 

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:01.430 align:start position:0%
right like how can you stay
for<00:17:59.280><c> long</c><00:17:59.440><c> enough</c><00:17:59.679><c> to</c><00:17:59.760><c> get</c><00:18:00.000><c> the</c><00:18:00.080><c> value</c><00:18:00.960><c> without</c>

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
for long enough to get the value without
 

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.029 align:start position:0%
for long enough to get the value without
getting<00:18:01.760><c> trapped</c>

00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
getting trapped
 

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:04.710 align:start position:0%
