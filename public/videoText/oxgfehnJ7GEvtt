completely on the same wavelength and
 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.469 align:start position:0%
completely on the same wavelength and
that's<00:04:14.989><c> when</c><00:04:15.579><c> structure</c><00:04:16.579><c> and</c><00:04:16.849><c> hierarchy</c><00:04:17.030><c> and</c>

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
that's when structure and hierarchy and
 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.909 align:start position:0%
that's when structure and hierarchy and

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 align:start position:0%
some kind of management starts to become
 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.430 align:start position:0%
some kind of management starts to become
more<00:04:19.459><c> important</c><00:04:19.940><c> and</c><00:04:20.810><c> so</c><00:04:21.019><c> I</c><00:04:21.049><c> think</c><00:04:21.199><c> it's</c>

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
more important and so I think it's
 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
more important and so I think it's
really<00:04:21.739><c> just</c><00:04:21.950><c> I</c><00:04:22.279><c> think</c><00:04:23.120><c> like</c><00:04:23.389><c> when</c><00:04:23.570><c> you</c><00:04:23.690><c> have</c><00:04:23.900><c> a</c>

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 align:start position:0%
really just I think like when you have a
 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.780 align:start position:0%
really just I think like when you have a
lot<00:04:24.110><c> of</c><00:04:24.139><c> people</c><00:04:24.320><c> who</c><00:04:24.740><c> have</c><00:04:25.520><c> seen</c><00:04:25.820><c> success</c>

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 align:start position:0%
at these very small stages and there
 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
at these very small stages and there
they<00:04:29.490><c> believe</c><00:04:29.910><c> incorrectly</c><00:04:30.870><c> that</c><00:04:31.350><c> the</c><00:04:31.800><c> thing</c>

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 align:start position:0%
they believe incorrectly that the thing
 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
they believe incorrectly that the thing
that<00:04:32.160><c> made</c><00:04:32.310><c> them</c><00:04:32.400><c> successful</c><00:04:32.580><c> was</c><00:04:33.060><c> just</c><00:04:33.300><c> like</c>

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 align:start position:0%
that made them successful was just like
 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.490 align:start position:0%
that made them successful was just like

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.900 align:start position:0%
well we just got these smart people

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.850 align:start position:0%
together and let them do what they

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
thought was right and you know success
 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
thought was right and you know success
happen<00:04:38.220><c> yeah</c><00:04:38.570><c> you</c><00:04:39.570><c> can</c><00:04:39.690><c> take</c><00:04:39.840><c> the</c><00:04:39.930><c> kind</c><00:04:40.110><c> of</c>

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 align:start position:0%
happen yeah you can take the kind of
 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.870 align:start position:0%
happen yeah you can take the kind of
wrong<00:04:40.350><c> lesson</c><00:04:40.770><c> from</c><00:04:41.130><c> that</c><00:04:41.340><c> and</c><00:04:41.580><c> I</c><00:04:41.640><c> think</c><00:04:41.670><c> that</c>

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
wrong lesson from that and I think that
 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.430 align:start position:0%
wrong lesson from that and I think that
contributes<00:04:42.660><c> to</c><00:04:43.040><c> this</c><00:04:44.040><c> sort</c><00:04:44.400><c> of</c><00:04:44.520><c> you</c><00:04:45.450><c> know</c><00:04:45.480><c> not</c>

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
contributes to this sort of you know not
 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
contributes to this sort of you know not
a<00:04:46.770><c> disregard</c><00:04:47.370><c> for</c><00:04:47.550><c> management</c><00:04:47.850><c> right</c><00:04:48.360><c> and</c>

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 align:start position:0%
a disregard for management right and
 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.230 align:start position:0%
a disregard for management right and
what<00:04:49.050><c> stuck</c><00:04:49.320><c> out</c><00:04:49.440><c> to</c><00:04:49.500><c> me</c><00:04:49.680><c> was</c><00:04:50.400><c> the</c><00:04:50.550><c> books</c><00:04:50.790><c> focus</c>

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
what stuck out to me was the books focus
 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.810 align:start position:0%
what stuck out to me was the books focus

very much about like this is your
 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.910 align:start position:0%
very much about like this is your

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
technical job and then all of a sudden
 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.230 align:start position:0%
technical job and then all of a sudden
you're<00:05:02.220><c> transitioning</c><00:05:02.490><c> to</c><00:05:02.790><c> another</c><00:05:03.030><c> job</c>

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
you're transitioning to another job
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're transitioning to another job
which<00:05:03.570><c> is</c><00:05:03.690><c> technical</c><00:05:04.110><c> just</c><00:05:04.380><c> in</c><00:05:04.500><c> a</c><00:05:04.590><c> different</c>

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 align:start position:0%
which is technical just in a different
 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.150 align:start position:0%
which is technical just in a different
way

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
way
 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
way
yeah<00:05:05.340><c> so</c><00:05:05.970><c> I</c><00:05:06.330><c> I</c><00:05:06.540><c> think</c><00:05:06.990><c> maybe</c><00:05:07.500><c> what</c><00:05:07.770><c> would</c><00:05:07.830><c> be</c>

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I think maybe what would be
 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.860 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I think maybe what would be
most<00:05:08.130><c> helpful</c><00:05:08.280><c> for</c><00:05:08.520><c> us</c><00:05:08.820><c> to</c><00:05:09.030><c> talk</c><00:05:09.240><c> about</c><00:05:09.270><c> are</c>

I<00:05:18.000><c> mean</c><00:05:18.270><c> you</c><00:05:18.360><c> have</c><00:05:18.510><c> different</c><00:05:18.930><c> like</c><00:05:19.050><c> tech</c><00:05:19.290><c> lead</c>

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
I mean you have different like tech lead
 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.570 align:start position:0%
I mean you have different like tech lead
and<00:05:19.710><c> all</c><00:05:19.800><c> kinds</c><00:05:20.040><c> of</c><00:05:20.100><c> different</c><00:05:20.250><c> roles</c><00:05:20.490><c> for</c>

she was not an engineer
 

00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
she was not an engineer
yeah<00:40:17.449><c> and</c><00:40:18.079><c> so</c><00:40:18.559><c> if</c><00:40:18.919><c> you</c><00:40:19.099><c> are</c><00:40:19.249><c> an</c><00:40:19.399><c> executive</c><00:40:19.669><c> or</c><00:40:20.179><c> a</c>

very very senior manager you might have
 

00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
very very senior manager you might have
to<00:40:23.809><c> report</c><00:40:24.019><c> to</c><00:40:24.109><c> a</c><00:40:24.199><c> non</c><00:40:24.319><c> engineer</c><00:40:24.679><c> and</c><00:40:24.799><c> you</c>

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:24.890 align:start position:0%
to report to a non engineer and you
 

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:25.809 align:start position:0%
to report to a non engineer and you
should<00:40:25.039><c> feel</c><00:40:25.159><c> very</c><00:40:25.189><c> comfortable</c><00:40:25.459><c> with</c><00:40:25.759><c> that</c>

00:40:25.819 --> 00:40:28.870 align:start position:0%
should feel very comfortable with that

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
but I I think that it's really important
 

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.169 align:start position:0%
but I I think that it's really important
to<00:40:29.089><c> have</c><00:40:29.209><c> engineers</c><00:40:30.369><c> former</c><00:40:31.369><c> engineers</c><00:40:31.819><c> be</c>

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:25.030 align:start position:0%
always have that leader vibe what would
 

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:26.250 align:start position:0%
always have that leader vibe what would
you<00:46:25.119><c> say</c><00:46:25.270><c> to</c><00:46:25.359><c> that</c><00:46:25.420><c> person</c><00:46:25.780><c> how</c><00:46:25.900><c> do</c><00:46:25.960><c> they</c><00:46:26.109><c> build</c>

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:26.260 align:start position:0%
you say to that person how do they build
 

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.140 align:start position:0%
you say to that person how do they build
it<00:46:26.440><c> up</c>

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:27.150 align:start position:0%
it up
 

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:29.420 align:start position:0%
it up
so<00:46:27.960><c> I</c><00:46:27.990><c> mean</c><00:46:28.380><c> it</c><00:46:28.470><c> would</c><00:46:28.560><c> very</c><00:46:28.830><c> much</c><00:46:28.890><c> depend</c><00:46:29.340><c> on</c>

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:29.430 align:start position:0%
so I mean it would very much depend on
 

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.580 align:start position:0%
so I mean it would very much depend on
the<00:46:29.580><c> person</c><00:46:29.970><c> right</c><00:46:30.180><c> but</c><00:46:30.450><c> like</c><00:46:30.660><c> I</c><00:46:30.930><c> think</c><00:46:31.290><c> what</c><00:46:31.560><c> I</c>

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:31.590 align:start position:0%
the person right but like I think what I
 

00:46:31.590 --> 00:46:34.130 align:start position:0%
the person right but like I think what I
