any kind of preview of what he was
 

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.410 align:start position:0%
any kind of preview of what he was
thinking<00:17:20.720><c> in</c><00:17:21.280><c> it</c><00:17:22.280><c> so</c><00:17:22.520><c> the</c><00:17:22.670><c> note</c><00:17:23.090><c> because</c>

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:23.420 align:start position:0%
thinking in it so the note because
 

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
thinking in it so the note because
nothing<00:17:24.110><c> had</c><00:17:24.260><c> been</c><00:17:24.500><c> nobody</c><00:17:25.040><c> been</c><00:17:25.190><c> cast</c><00:17:25.520><c> then</c>

actually go around judging others as

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:49.299 align:start position:0%
conscious that's a point that you make

as<00:20:49.419><c> well</c><00:20:49.539><c> it's</c><00:20:49.720><c> just</c><00:20:49.779><c> I</c><00:20:50.049><c> just</c><00:20:50.080><c> naturally</c><00:20:50.890><c> treat</c>

00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:51.429 align:start position:0%
as well it's just I just naturally treat
 

00:20:51.429 --> 00:20:53.190 align:start position:0%
as well it's just I just naturally treat
them<00:20:51.580><c> as</c><00:20:51.730><c> conscious</c><00:20:52.149><c> and</c><00:20:52.659><c> so</c><00:20:52.840><c> why</c><00:20:53.020><c> do</c><00:20:53.080><c> I</c>

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
them as conscious and so why do I
 

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.269 align:start position:0%
them as conscious and so why do I
naturally<00:20:53.380><c> treat</c><00:20:53.770><c> them</c><00:20:53.890><c> as</c><00:20:53.950><c> conscious</c>

00:20:54.269 --> 00:20:54.279 align:start position:0%
naturally treat them as conscious
 

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
naturally treat them as conscious
because<00:20:54.460><c> their</c><00:20:54.970><c> behavior</c><00:20:55.419><c> is</c><00:20:55.720><c> such</c><00:20:55.929><c> that</c>

00:20:56.159 --> 00:20:56.169 align:start position:0%
because their behavior is such that
 

00:20:56.169 --> 00:20:57.539 align:start position:0%
because their behavior is such that
that's<00:20:56.440><c> that</c><00:20:56.830><c> they're</c><00:20:57.010><c> just</c><00:20:57.159><c> like</c><00:20:57.340><c> fellow</c>

00:20:57.539 --> 00:20:57.549 align:start position:0%
that's that they're just like fellow
 

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's that they're just like fellow
creatures<00:20:58.000><c> and</c><00:20:58.240><c> I</c><00:20:58.299><c> just</c><00:20:58.510><c> do</c><00:20:58.690><c> that</c><00:20:59.260><c> and</c><00:20:59.409><c> that's</c>

00:20:59.460 --> 00:20:59.470 align:start position:0%
creatures and I just do that and that's
 

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:00.870 align:start position:0%
creatures and I just do that and that's
just<00:20:59.590><c> what</c><00:20:59.799><c> you</c><00:20:59.890><c> do</c><00:21:00.070><c> when</c><00:21:00.340><c> you</c><00:21:00.429><c> encounter</c><00:21:00.669><c> a</c>

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
just what you do when you encounter a
 

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.669 align:start position:0%
just what you do when you encounter a
fellow<00:21:01.059><c> creature</c><00:21:01.270><c> you</c><00:21:01.570><c> know</c><00:21:01.659><c> think</c><00:21:02.440><c> carefully</c>

00:21:02.669 --> 00:21:02.679 align:start position:0%
fellow creature you know think carefully
 

00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
fellow creature you know think carefully
about<00:21:02.860><c> it</c><00:21:03.039><c> and</c><00:21:03.870><c> so</c><00:21:04.870><c> this</c><00:21:05.230><c> is</c><00:21:05.350><c> an</c><00:21:05.980><c> important</c><00:21:06.399><c> bit</c>

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:06.610 align:start position:0%
about it and so this is an important bit
 

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.490 align:start position:0%
about it and so this is an important bit
continuing<00:21:07.149><c> point</c><00:21:07.480><c> that</c><00:21:07.659><c> I</c><00:21:07.750><c> bring</c><00:21:08.049><c> out</c><00:21:08.169><c> in</c><00:21:08.380><c> the</c>

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:12.130 align:start position:0%
in the book very much and in a sense
 

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
in the book very much and in a sense
that's<00:21:12.340><c> very</c><00:21:12.880><c> much</c><00:21:13.000><c> what</c><00:21:13.059><c> happens</c><00:21:13.480><c> to</c><00:21:13.659><c> Caleb</c>

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:13.990 align:start position:0%
that's very much what happens to Caleb
 

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.690 align:start position:0%
that's very much what happens to Caleb
so<00:21:14.260><c> Kayla</c><00:21:14.500><c> doesn't</c><00:21:14.830><c> you</c><00:21:15.130><c> know</c><00:21:15.190><c> isn't</c><00:21:15.460><c> sort</c><00:21:15.640><c> of</c>

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:15.700 align:start position:0%
so Kayla doesn't you know isn't sort of
 

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
so Kayla doesn't you know isn't sort of

sitting making notes saying therefore
 

00:21:17.649 --> 00:21:18.690 align:start position:0%

she<00:21:18.100><c> is</c><00:21:18.190><c> conscious</c>

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:18.700 align:start position:0%
she is conscious
 

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
she is conscious
yeah<00:21:18.850><c> but</c><00:21:19.029><c> rather</c><00:21:19.179><c> through</c><00:21:19.899><c> interacting</c><00:21:20.620><c> with</c>

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:20.830 align:start position:0%
yeah but rather through interacting with
 

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.370 align:start position:0%
yeah but rather through interacting with

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:23.380 align:start position:0%
her he just gradually comes to feel that
 

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
her he just gradually comes to feel that
she<00:21:23.529><c> is</c><00:21:23.649><c> conscious</c><00:21:23.860><c> just</c><00:21:24.010><c> and</c><00:21:24.580><c> to</c><00:21:24.669><c> start</c>

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:24.850 align:start position:0%
she is conscious just and to start
 

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.110 align:start position:0%
she is conscious just and to start
treating<00:21:25.299><c> her</c><00:21:25.419><c> as</c><00:21:25.710><c> conscious</c><00:21:26.710><c> and</c><00:21:27.100><c> so</c><00:21:27.520><c> that's</c>

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
treating her as conscious and so that's
 

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
treating her as conscious and so that's
a<00:21:28.240><c> very</c><00:21:28.890><c> something</c><00:21:29.890><c> very</c><00:21:30.039><c> victims</c><00:21:30.520><c> Tinian</c>

about<00:21:31.149><c> that</c><00:21:31.360><c> and</c><00:21:31.539><c> then</c><00:21:31.630><c> I</c><00:21:31.720><c> think</c><00:21:31.779><c> probably</c>

00:21:32.159 --> 00:21:32.169 align:start position:0%
about that and then I think probably
 

00:21:32.169 --> 00:21:34.590 align:start position:0%
about that and then I think probably
that<00:21:32.409><c> comes</c><00:21:32.710><c> from</c><00:21:33.100><c> I'd</c><00:21:33.520><c> like</c><00:21:33.760><c> to</c><00:21:33.880><c> think</c><00:21:34.029><c> I</c><00:21:34.270><c> come</c>

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
in and then I think they decided this
 

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.830 align:start position:0%
in and then I think they decided this
didn't<00:24:05.160><c> really</c><00:24:05.220><c> work</c><00:24:05.520><c> terribly</c><00:24:05.910><c> well</c><00:24:06.030><c> to</c><00:24:06.420><c> do</c>

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
didn't really work terribly well to do
 

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.330 align:start position:0%
didn't really work terribly well to do
that<00:24:06.870><c> at</c><00:24:07.140><c> that</c><00:24:07.230><c> point</c><00:24:07.410><c> now</c><00:24:07.559><c> so</c><00:24:07.740><c> they</c><00:24:07.860><c> kind</c><00:24:08.309><c> of</c>

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
that at that point now so they kind of
 

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.580 align:start position:0%
that at that point now so they kind of
cut<00:24:08.580><c> it</c><00:24:08.730><c> out</c><00:24:08.880><c> so</c><00:24:09.240><c> in</c><00:24:09.660><c> the</c><00:24:09.870><c> version</c><00:24:10.200><c> that</c><00:24:10.260><c> we</c><00:24:10.380><c> see</c>

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:10.590 align:start position:0%

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.130 align:start position:0%
cut it out so in the version that we see
you<00:24:11.040><c> don't</c><00:24:11.250><c> actually</c><00:24:11.430><c> see</c><00:24:11.910><c> that</c><00:24:12.600><c> that</c><00:24:13.110><c> you</c>

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
would also so just so I understand it
 

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.380 align:start position:0%
would also so just so I understand it
was<00:25:27.840><c> it</c><00:25:28.110><c> was</c><00:25:28.230><c> a</c><00:25:28.260><c> VFX</c><00:25:28.679><c> over</c><00:25:29.040><c> the</c><00:25:29.160><c> actual</c><00:25:29.790><c> image</c>

right<00:25:30.990><c> well</c><00:25:31.380><c> I</c><00:25:31.530><c> mean</c><00:25:31.679><c> it</c><00:25:31.770><c> doesn't</c><00:25:32.010><c> in</c><00:25:32.070><c> the</c>

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
right well I mean it doesn't in the
 

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.970 align:start position:0%
right well I mean it doesn't in the
script<00:25:32.580><c> it</c><00:25:32.700><c> doesn't</c><00:25:32.970><c> specify</c><00:25:33.650><c> exactly</c><00:25:34.650><c> how</c><00:25:34.740><c> it</c>

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.190 align:start position:0%
script it doesn't specify exactly how it

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
to be how it will be done so it just
 

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.230 align:start position:0%
to be how it will be done so it just
says<00:25:37.350><c> something</c><00:25:37.710><c> like</c><00:25:37.890><c> we</c><00:25:38.130><c> see</c><00:25:38.400><c> facial</c>

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
says something like we see facial
 

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.060 align:start position:0%

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
hands that it's got so clearly we've
 

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
hands that it's got so clearly we've

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:14.710 align:start position:0%
changed a lot in our view of what we
 

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:16.230 align:start position:0%
changed a lot in our view of what we

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
think we can the kinds of bodies we
 

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
think we can the kinds of bodies we

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:17.770 align:start position:0%
think that we might be able to make in
 

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:19.530 align:start position:0%
think that we might be able to make in
there<00:35:17.980><c> and</c><00:35:18.490><c> I</c><00:35:18.760><c> think</c><00:35:19.060><c> it's</c><00:35:19.150><c> also</c><00:35:19.270><c> quite</c>

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:19.540 align:start position:0%
there and I think it's also quite
 

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.910 align:start position:0%
there and I think it's also quite

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
difficult because there's there's not
 

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.650 align:start position:0%
difficult because there's there's not
really<00:35:21.190><c> a</c><00:35:21.310><c> clear</c><00:35:21.520><c> benchmarking</c><00:35:22.210><c> happening</c>

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:22.660 align:start position:0%
really a clear benchmarking happening
 

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
really a clear benchmarking happening
right<00:35:22.780><c> now</c><00:35:22.840><c> that</c><00:35:23.230><c> it</c><00:35:23.350><c> because</c><00:35:23.590><c> it's</c><00:35:23.710><c> not</c>

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:23.830 align:start position:0%
right now that it because it's not
 

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
right now that it because it's not
obvious<00:35:23.980><c> it</c><00:35:24.490><c> was</c><00:35:24.670><c> if</c><00:35:24.910><c> it</c><00:35:25.120><c> was</c><00:35:25.240><c> just</c><00:35:25.420><c> like</c><00:35:25.630><c> you</c>

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.170 align:start position:0%
obvious it was if it was just like you
 

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:28.470 align:start position:0%
obvious it was if it was just like you
know<00:35:26.290><c> energy</c><00:35:26.560><c> and</c><00:35:27.100><c> compute</c><00:35:27.790><c> going</c><00:35:28.150><c> into</c><00:35:28.360><c> this</c>

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
know energy and compute going into this
 

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.390 align:start position:0%
know energy and compute going into this
then<00:35:29.080><c> the</c><00:35:29.290><c> race</c><00:35:29.470><c> would</c><00:35:29.680><c> be</c><00:35:29.830><c> I</c><00:35:30.070><c> mean</c><00:35:30.100><c> it</c>

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
then the race would be I mean it
 

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
then the race would be I mean it
wouldn't<00:35:30.550><c> be</c><00:35:30.610><c> over</c><00:35:30.910><c> but</c><00:35:31.090><c> it</c><00:35:31.180><c> would</c><00:35:31.270><c> be</c><00:35:31.390><c> very</c>

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:31.570 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be over but it would be very
 

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:33.030 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be over but it would be very

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
obvious as who's winning and what's
 

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
obvious as who's winning and what's
going<00:35:33.190><c> on</c><00:35:33.370><c> yeah</c><00:35:33.880><c> we're</c><00:35:34.150><c> there</c><00:35:34.270><c> it</c><00:35:34.720><c> seems</c><00:35:34.900><c> to</c><00:35:35.020><c> be</c>

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:35.110 align:start position:0%
going on yeah we're there it seems to be
 

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
going on yeah we're there it seems to be
that<00:35:35.260><c> they're</c><00:35:35.380><c> clear</c><00:35:35.680><c> breakthrough</c>

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.190 align:start position:0%
that they're clear breakthrough
 

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.010 align:start position:0%
that they're clear breakthrough

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.470 align:start position:0%

that's<00:35:38.320><c> certainly</c><00:35:38.590><c> my</c><00:35:38.890><c> my</c><00:35:39.250><c> view</c><00:35:39.310><c> so</c><00:35:39.760><c> it</c><00:35:40.060><c> so</c><00:35:40.420><c> if</c>

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's certainly my my view so it so if
 

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.730 align:start position:0%
that's certainly my my view so it so if
we're<00:35:40.630><c> thinking</c><00:35:40.660><c> about</c><00:35:40.900><c> now</c><00:35:41.200><c> the</c><00:35:41.260><c> question</c><00:35:41.650><c> of</c>

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:41.740 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about now the question of
 

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.540 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about now the question of
when<00:35:42.130><c> might</c><00:35:42.370><c> we</c><00:35:42.670><c> get</c><00:35:42.970><c> to</c><00:35:43.090><c> human-level</c><00:35:43.510><c> AI</c><00:35:43.690><c> yeah</c>

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:44.550 align:start position:0%
when might we get to human-level AI yeah
 

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.030 align:start position:0%
when might we get to human-level AI yeah
artificial<00:35:45.550><c> general</c><00:35:46.090><c> intelligence</c><00:35:46.300><c> then</c><00:35:47.040><c> I</c>

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
artificial general intelligence then I
 

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
artificial general intelligence then I
think<00:35:48.430><c> we</c><00:35:48.550><c> really</c><00:35:48.760><c> don't</c><00:35:49.090><c> know</c><00:35:49.360><c> and</c><00:35:49.570><c> as</c>

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:49.690 align:start position:0%
think we really don't know and as
 

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%

certainly<00:35:50.320><c> some</c><00:35:50.530><c> people</c><00:35:50.800><c> can</c><00:35:51.010><c> you</c><00:35:51.550><c> know</c><00:35:51.670><c> you</c>

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:51.730 align:start position:0%

an online base of errors yeah yeah or
 

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.150 align:start position:0%
an online base of errors yeah yeah or
even<00:46:07.660><c> sit</c><00:46:07.810><c> or</c><00:46:07.930><c> even</c><00:46:08.230><c> pond</c><00:46:08.440><c> or</c><00:46:08.650><c> something</c><00:46:08.740><c> like</c>

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
even sit or even pond or something like
 

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
even sit or even pond or something like
that<00:46:09.370><c> so</c><00:46:10.150><c> it</c><00:46:10.390><c> takes</c><00:46:10.570><c> an</c><00:46:10.660><c> awful</c><00:46:10.750><c> long</c><00:46:11.020><c> time</c><00:46:11.050><c> to</c>

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:11.230 align:start position:0%
that so it takes an awful long time to

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:20.560 align:start position:0%

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:51.220 align:start position:0%
called brain room okay hmm and that MoMA
 

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
called brain room okay hmm and that MoMA
in<00:49:51.550><c> New</c><00:49:51.609><c> York</c><00:49:51.849><c> yes</c><00:49:52.270><c> that's</c><00:49:52.540><c> right</c><00:49:52.690><c> yeah</c>

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:52.930 align:start position:0%
in New York yes that's right yeah
 

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:55.349 align:start position:0%
in New York yes that's right yeah
exactly<00:49:52.960><c> yeah</c><00:49:53.589><c> so</c><00:49:53.890><c> it's</c><00:49:54.040><c> to</c><00:49:54.220><c> it</c><00:49:54.280><c> but</c><00:49:54.730><c> it</c><00:49:54.940><c> was</c><00:49:55.089><c> no</c>

00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah so it's to it but it was no
 

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah so it's to it but it was no
it<00:49:55.780><c> wasn't</c><00:49:56.080><c> ever</c><00:49:56.170><c> in</c><00:49:56.290><c> New</c><00:49:56.440><c> York</c><00:49:56.650><c> indeed</c><00:49:56.950><c> yeah</c>

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:57.130 align:start position:0%
it wasn't ever in New York indeed yeah
 

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
it wasn't ever in New York indeed yeah
so<00:49:58.000><c> it</c><00:49:58.150><c> so</c><00:49:58.270><c> the</c><00:49:58.390><c> idea</c><00:49:58.630><c> there</c><00:49:58.810><c> is</c><00:49:58.839><c> that</c><00:49:58.990><c> as</c><00:49:59.260><c> you</c>

00:49:59.400 --> 00:49:59.410 align:start position:0%
so it so the idea there is that as you
 

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:02.370 align:start position:0%
so it so the idea there is that as you
since<00:49:59.800><c> all</c><00:49:59.950><c> their</c><00:50:00.250><c> their</c><00:50:00.640><c> art</c><00:50:00.849><c> is</c><00:50:01.380><c> using</c>

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:02.380 align:start position:0%
since all their their art is using
 

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.290 align:start position:0%
since all their their art is using

you<00:50:13.240><c> the</c><00:50:13.750><c> idea</c><00:50:14.020><c> is</c><00:50:14.140><c> it's</c><00:50:14.290><c> a</c><00:50:14.380><c> room</c><00:50:14.589><c> with</c>

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
you the idea is it's a room with
 

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
you the idea is it's a room with

everywhere<00:50:18.190><c> but</c><00:50:18.790><c> there's</c><00:50:19.180><c> some</c><00:50:19.330><c> clever</c>

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:19.560 align:start position:0%

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere but there's some clever
technology<00:50:20.560><c> that</c><00:50:20.740><c> senses</c><00:50:21.160><c> where</c><00:50:21.369><c> you</c><00:50:21.580><c> are</c><00:50:21.760><c> and</c>

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:21.970 align:start position:0%
technology that senses where you are and
 

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:23.859 align:start position:0%
technology that senses where you are and
you<00:50:22.060><c> worked</c><00:50:22.210><c> on</c><00:50:22.330><c> that</c><00:50:22.390><c> and</c><00:50:22.869><c> know</c>

00:50:23.859 --> 00:50:23.869 align:start position:0%
you worked on that and know
 

00:50:23.869 --> 00:50:26.259 align:start position:0%
you worked on that and know
all<00:50:24.109><c> right</c><00:50:24.259><c> company</c><00:50:25.190><c> I</c><00:50:25.220><c> should</c><00:50:25.640><c> finish</c><00:50:25.789><c> yes</c>

00:50:26.259 --> 00:50:26.269 align:start position:0%
all right company I should finish yes
 

00:50:26.269 --> 00:50:28.809 align:start position:0%
all right company I should finish yes
yes<00:50:26.720><c> so</c><00:50:27.109><c> there's</c><00:50:27.589><c> some</c><00:50:27.710><c> clever</c><00:50:28.309><c> technology</c>

00:50:28.809 --> 00:50:28.819 align:start position:0%
yes so there's some clever technology

yes so there's some clever technology
that<00:50:28.999><c> senses</c><00:50:29.359><c> where</c><00:50:29.509><c> where</c><00:50:30.230><c> you</c><00:50:30.680><c> are</c><00:50:30.829><c> and</c>
