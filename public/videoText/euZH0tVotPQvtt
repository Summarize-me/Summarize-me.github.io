that
 

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
that
the<00:08:59.600><c> only</c><00:08:59.760><c> way</c><00:08:59.920><c> to</c><00:09:00.000><c> get</c><00:09:00.160><c> this</c><00:09:00.399><c> kind</c><00:09:00.560><c> of</c><00:09:00.720><c> signal</c>

right so you get this you get this
 

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.190 align:start position:0%
right so you get this you get this
rejection<00:09:05.600><c> the</c><00:09:05.680><c> first</c><00:09:05.920><c> time</c><00:09:06.160><c> the</c><00:09:06.320><c> second</c><00:09:06.640><c> time</c>

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
rejection the first time the second time
 

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.110 align:start position:0%

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
idea do you pattern match to founders
 

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.990 align:start position:0%
idea do you pattern match to founders
i've<00:10:56.480><c> had</c><00:10:56.640><c> success</c><00:10:56.880><c> within</c><00:10:57.120><c> the</c><00:10:57.279><c> past</c><00:10:57.920><c> and</c>
