rules of the game and play the game with
 

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.350 align:start position:0%
rules of the game and play the game with

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
on the credential game will help you
 

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.829 align:start position:0%
on the credential game will help you
with<00:12:20.040><c> your</c><00:12:20.220><c> long-term</c><00:12:20.700><c> goals</c><00:12:21.060><c> yeah</c><00:12:21.420><c> I</c><00:12:21.720><c> think</c>

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
with your long-term goals yeah I think
 

00:12:21.839 --> 00:12:24.110 align:start position:0%
with your long-term goals yeah I think
that's<00:12:22.019><c> much</c><00:12:22.260><c> better</c><00:12:22.500><c> than</c><00:12:22.860><c> like</c><00:12:23.160><c> rejecting</c>

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's much better than like rejecting
 

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.090 align:start position:0%
that's much better than like rejecting
the<00:12:24.360><c> system</c><00:12:24.540><c> out</c><00:12:24.899><c> of</c><00:12:25.019><c> hand</c><00:12:25.200><c> it's</c><00:12:25.860><c> basically</c>

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
the system out of hand it's basically
 

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.430 align:start position:0%
the system out of hand it's basically
like<00:12:26.399><c> either</c><00:12:26.640><c> extreme</c><00:12:27.000><c> is</c><00:12:27.180><c> bad</c><00:12:27.440><c> rejecting</c>

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
like either extreme is bad rejecting
 

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
like either extreme is bad rejecting
that<00:12:28.620><c> like</c>

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
that like
 

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.250 align:start position:0%
that like
fundamentally<00:12:30.480><c> you</c><00:12:30.660><c> understand</c><00:12:30.779><c> the</c><00:12:31.079><c> system</c>

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
fundamentally you understand the system
 

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.569 align:start position:0%
fundamentally you understand the system
is<00:12:31.440><c> somewhat</c><00:12:31.740><c> arbitrary</c><00:12:32.100><c> right</c><00:12:32.279><c> if</c><00:12:32.459><c> you're</c>

00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:32.579 align:start position:0%
is somewhat arbitrary right if you're
 

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:33.829 align:start position:0%
is somewhat arbitrary right if you're

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
smart enough you understand that right
 

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:35.930 align:start position:0%
smart enough you understand that right
yes<00:12:33.959><c> and</c><00:12:34.200><c> with</c><00:12:34.440><c> that</c><00:12:34.620><c> understanding</c><00:12:35.100><c> you</c><00:12:35.820><c> can</c>

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
yes and with that understanding you can
 

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.690 align:start position:0%
yes and with that understanding you can
reject<00:12:36.480><c> the</c><00:12:36.720><c> system</c><00:12:36.959><c> and</c><00:12:37.920><c> then</c><00:12:38.100><c> like</c><00:12:38.399><c> because</c>

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
reject the system and then like because
 

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.949 align:start position:0%
reject the system and then like because
you<00:12:38.940><c> don't</c><00:12:39.120><c> have</c><00:12:39.240><c> the</c><00:12:39.360><c> right</c><00:12:39.480><c> credentials</c>

it'll hold you back you can somehow not

the<00:14:18.540><c> tricky</c><00:14:18.839><c> bit</c><00:14:19.019><c> about</c><00:14:19.579><c> fads</c><00:14:20.579><c> is</c><00:14:20.700><c> it's</c><00:14:20.940><c> kind</c>

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
the tricky bit about fads is it's kind
 

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
the tricky bit about fads is it's kind
of<00:14:21.240><c> like</c><00:14:21.480><c> what</c><00:14:22.260><c> we</c><00:14:22.380><c> said</c><00:14:22.560><c> before</c><00:14:22.740><c> about</c>

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
of like what we said before about
 

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.190 align:start position:0%
of like what we said before about

understanding the credential system the
 

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.470 align:start position:0%
understanding the credential system the

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
fads are just like another system right
 

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.850 align:start position:0%
fads are just like another system right
and<00:14:27.839><c> I</c><00:14:27.959><c> think</c><00:14:28.079><c> you</c><00:14:28.320><c> kind</c><00:14:28.500><c> of</c><00:14:28.620><c> have</c><00:14:28.680><c> to</c>

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
and I think you kind of have to
 

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.230 align:start position:0%
