00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's a good intuition I mean you know
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.810 align:start position:0%
it's a good intuition I mean you know
yeah

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.510 align:start position:0%

OOP<00:02:36.360><c> so</c><00:02:36.660><c> maybe</c><00:02:37.020><c> the</c><00:02:37.200><c> best</c><00:02:37.230><c> way</c><00:02:37.620><c> to</c><00:02:37.920><c> start</c><00:02:38.340><c> is</c>

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
OOP so maybe the best way to start is
 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.530 align:start position:0%
OOP so maybe the best way to start is
then<00:02:38.670><c> talk</c><00:02:38.880><c> about</c><00:02:39.090><c> like</c><00:02:39.210><c> what</c><00:02:39.360><c> are</c><00:02:39.450><c> you</c>

are at listening to how people use what
we're<00:08:11.349><c> doing</c><00:08:11.590><c> and</c><00:08:12.190><c> so</c><00:08:12.669><c> what</c><00:08:12.849><c> what</c><00:08:13.479><c> are</c><00:08:13.660><c> artists</c>

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.110 align:start position:0%
we're doing and so what what are artists
 

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
we're doing and so what what are artists
using<00:08:14.289><c> it</c><00:08:14.440><c> for</c><00:08:14.620><c> it's</c><00:08:14.740><c> at</c><00:08:15.099><c> this</c><00:08:15.310><c> point</c><00:08:15.370><c> right</c>

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.150 align:start position:0%
using it for it's at this point right

using it for it's at this point right
now<00:08:16.210><c> so</c><00:08:16.599><c> we</c><00:08:17.050><c> have</c><00:08:17.199><c> most</c><00:08:18.130><c> of</c><00:08:18.250><c> what</c><00:08:18.400><c> we've</c><00:08:18.550><c> done</c>

00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:18.669 align:start position:0%

so<00:08:18.880><c> far</c><00:08:18.910><c> is</c><00:08:19.060><c> had</c><00:08:19.389><c> to</c><00:08:19.449><c> do</c><00:08:19.539><c> with</c><00:08:19.630><c> music</c><00:08:19.750><c> yeah</c><00:08:20.410><c> if</c>

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:20.830 align:start position:0%
so far is had to do with music yeah if

dumb<00:14:24.189><c> dumb</c><00:14:24.220><c> dumb</c><00:14:24.549><c> right</c><00:14:25.269><c> yeah</c><00:14:25.749><c> and</c><00:14:25.959><c> then</c><00:14:26.439><c> and</c>

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:26.740 align:start position:0%
dumb dumb dumb right yeah and then and
 

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.259 align:start position:0%
dumb dumb dumb right yeah and then and
then<00:14:26.889><c> the</c><00:14:27.009><c> musician</c><00:14:27.369><c> says</c><00:14:27.519><c> oh</c><00:14:27.670><c> I</c><00:14:27.699><c> see</c><00:14:27.999><c> let's</c><00:14:28.179><c> go</c>

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:28.269 align:start position:0%
then the musician says oh I see let's go
 

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:29.850 align:start position:0%
then the musician says oh I see let's go
up<00:14:28.329><c> to</c><00:14:28.389><c> the</c><00:14:28.480><c> fifth</c><00:14:28.689><c> and</c><00:14:28.869><c> and</c><00:14:29.319><c> then</c><00:14:29.439><c> you</c><00:14:29.679><c> get</c>

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:29.860 align:start position:0%
up to the fifth and and then you get
 

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.259 align:start position:0%
up to the fifth and and then you get
this<00:14:29.980><c> really</c><00:14:30.220><c> it's</c><00:14:30.429><c> almost</c><00:14:30.579><c> like</c><00:14:30.759><c> follow</c><00:14:31.059><c> the</c>

00:14:31.259 --> 00:14:31.269 align:start position:0%
this really it's almost like follow the
 

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.710 align:start position:0%
this really it's almost like follow the
leader

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
leader
 

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.150 align:start position:0%
leader
yeah<00:14:31.899><c> but</c><00:14:32.079><c> you're</c><00:14:32.199><c> following</c><00:14:32.589><c> the</c><00:14:32.679><c> model</c><00:14:32.980><c> and</c>

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
yeah but you're following the model and
 

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.069 align:start position:0%
yeah but you're following the model and
then<00:14:33.309><c> it's</c><00:14:33.490><c> super</c><00:14:33.699><c> fun</c><00:14:34.119><c> and</c><00:14:34.149><c> like</c><00:14:34.749><c> it's</c>

00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
then it's super fun and like it's
 

00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
then it's super fun and like it's
basically<00:14:35.559><c> a</c><00:14:35.860><c> challenge</c><00:14:36.610><c> for</c><00:14:36.819><c> the</c><00:14:36.910><c> musician</c>

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:37.529 align:start position:0%
basically a challenge for the musician
 

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:41.309 align:start position:0%
basically a challenge for the musician
to<00:14:38.529><c> to</c><00:14:39.339><c> try</c><00:14:39.730><c> to</c><00:14:40.179><c> understand</c><00:14:40.869><c> how</c><00:14:41.079><c> to</c><00:14:41.110><c> play</c>

00:14:41.309 --> 00:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
to to try to understand how to play
 

00:14:41.319 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
to to try to understand how to play
along<00:14:41.649><c> with</c><00:14:41.829><c> something</c><00:14:42.009><c> that's</c><00:14:42.220><c> so</c><00:14:42.339><c> primitive</c>

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:42.610 align:start position:0%
along with something that's so primitive
 

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
along with something that's so primitive
right<00:14:43.179><c> right</c><00:14:43.389><c> but</c><00:14:43.720><c> if</c><00:14:43.809><c> you</c><00:14:43.899><c> don't</c><00:14:44.049><c> have</c><00:14:44.170><c> the</c>

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.230 align:start position:0%
right right but if you don't have the
 

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.509 align:start position:0%
right right but if you don't have the
musical<00:14:44.559><c> so</c><00:14:44.740><c> basically</c><00:14:44.949><c> it's</c><00:14:45.129><c> the</c><00:14:45.220><c> musician</c>

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
musical so basically it's the musician
 

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.710 align:start position:0%
musical so basically it's the musician
bringing<00:14:45.819><c> all</c><00:14:45.939><c> the</c><00:14:46.059><c> skill</c><00:14:46.269><c> to</c><00:14:46.389><c> the</c><00:14:46.449><c> table</c>

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
bringing all the skill to the table
 

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.169 align:start position:0%
bringing all the skill to the table
right<00:14:46.809><c> yeah</c><00:14:46.959><c> so</c><00:14:47.139><c> like</c><00:14:47.799><c> even</c><00:14:48.369><c> even</c><00:14:48.879><c> with</c><00:14:48.999><c> the</c>

00:14:49.169 --> 00:14:49.179 align:start position:0%
right yeah so like even even with the
 

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:50.730 align:start position:0%
right yeah so like even even with the
the<00:14:49.209><c> primitive</c><00:14:49.899><c> sequence</c><00:14:50.139><c> generation</c><00:14:50.529><c> stuff</c>

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:50.740 align:start position:0%
the primitive sequence generation stuff
 

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.259 align:start position:0%
the primitive sequence generation stuff
like<00:14:51.069><c> it</c><00:14:51.309><c> still</c><00:14:51.610><c> been</c><00:14:51.819><c> interesting</c><00:14:52.149><c> to</c><00:14:52.240><c> see</c>

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:52.269 align:start position:0%
like it still been interesting to see
 

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:54.030 align:start position:0%
like it still been interesting to see
that<00:14:52.389><c> it's</c><00:14:52.660><c> it's</c><00:14:52.899><c> musicians</c><00:14:53.559><c> with</c><00:14:53.679><c> a</c><00:14:53.740><c> lot</c><00:14:53.920><c> of</c>

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
that it's it's musicians with a lot of
 

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
that it's it's musicians with a lot of
musical<00:14:54.490><c> talent</c><00:14:54.850><c> and</c><00:14:55.240><c> particularly</c><00:14:56.079><c> the</c>

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:56.290 align:start position:0%
musical talent and particularly the
 

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.109 align:start position:0%
musical talent and particularly the
ability<00:14:56.529><c> to</c><00:14:56.559><c> improvise</c><00:14:56.860><c> and</c><00:14:57.160><c> listen</c><00:14:57.459><c> that</c>

00:14:58.109 --> 00:14:58.119 align:start position:0%
ability to improvise and listen that
 

00:14:58.119 --> 00:14:59.970 align:start position:0%
ability to improvise and listen that
have<00:14:58.449><c> managed</c><00:14:58.839><c> to</c><00:14:58.869><c> actually</c><00:14:59.170><c> get</c><00:14:59.379><c> what</c><00:14:59.949><c> I</c>

00:14:59.970 --> 00:14:59.980 align:start position:0%
have managed to actually get what I
 

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.530 align:start position:0%
have managed to actually get what I
would<00:15:00.160><c> consider</c><00:15:00.279><c> interesting</c><00:15:00.819><c> results</c><00:15:01.389><c> out</c>

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:01.540 align:start position:0%
would consider interesting results out
 

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.230 align:start position:0%
would consider interesting results out
of<00:15:01.569><c> out</c><00:15:01.959><c> of</c><00:15:02.019><c> that</c><00:15:02.139><c> so</c><00:15:02.829><c> yeah</c><00:15:03.309><c> so</c><00:15:03.819><c> it's</c><00:15:03.970><c> become</c>

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
of out of that so yeah so it's become
 

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.090 align:start position:0%
of out of that so yeah so it's become
more<00:15:04.420><c> of</c><00:15:04.540><c> like</c><00:15:04.660><c> a</c><00:15:04.689><c> like</c><00:15:05.019><c> a</c><00:15:05.049><c> con</c><00:15:05.319><c> response</c><00:15:05.740><c> game</c>

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:06.100 align:start position:0%
more of like a like a con response game
 

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.249 align:start position:0%
more of like a like a con response game
than<00:15:06.519><c> a</c><00:15:06.549><c> tool</c><00:15:06.850><c> yeah</c><00:15:07.600><c> I</c><00:15:07.660><c> think</c><00:15:07.779><c> so</c>

00:15:08.249 --> 00:15:08.259 align:start position:0%
than a tool yeah I think so
 

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
than a tool yeah I think so
I<00:15:08.290><c> think</c><00:15:08.559><c> and</c><00:15:09.069><c> that's</c><00:15:09.189><c> partially</c><00:15:09.399><c> because</c><00:15:09.639><c> the</c>

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
I think and that's partially because the
 

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
I think and that's partially because the
model<00:15:10.379><c> the</c><00:15:11.379><c> models</c><00:15:11.709><c> pretty</c><00:15:11.920><c> primitive</c><00:15:12.160><c> I</c>

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:12.490 align:start position:0%
model the models pretty primitive I
 

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:16.470 align:start position:0%
model the models pretty primitive I
think<00:15:12.759><c> that</c><00:15:12.939><c> we</c><00:15:13.089><c> can</c><00:15:13.980><c> you</c><00:15:14.980><c> know</c><00:15:15.100><c> if</c><00:15:15.220><c> we</c><00:15:15.339><c> can</c><00:15:15.579><c> get</c>

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
think that we can you know if we can get
 

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.090 align:start position:0%
think that we can you know if we can get
the<00:15:16.600><c> data</c><00:15:16.779><c> pipelines</c><00:15:17.259><c> in</c><00:15:17.439><c> order</c><00:15:17.709><c> so</c><00:15:17.889><c> that</c><00:15:18.009><c> we</c>

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:18.100 align:start position:0%
the data pipelines in order so that we
 

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.530 align:start position:0%
the data pipelines in order so that we
know<00:15:18.249><c> what</c><00:15:18.429><c> we're</c><00:15:18.519><c> training</c><00:15:18.819><c> on</c><00:15:18.939><c> and</c><00:15:19.269><c> we</c><00:15:19.389><c> can</c>

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:19.540 align:start position:0%
know what we're training on and we can
 

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.039 align:start position:0%
know what we're training on and we can
actually<00:15:19.689><c> do</c><00:15:20.259><c> some</c><00:15:20.559><c> more</c><00:15:20.799><c> modern</c><00:15:22.049><c> sequence</c>

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:23.049 align:start position:0%
actually do some more modern sequence
 

00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:25.919 align:start position:0%
actually do some more modern sequence
learning<00:15:23.410><c> yeah</c><00:15:23.920><c> you</c><00:15:24.429><c> know</c><00:15:24.519><c> having</c><00:15:24.939><c> like</c><00:15:25.209><c> like</c>

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:25.929 align:start position:0%
learning yeah you know having like like
 

00:15:25.929 --> 00:15:27.809 align:start position:0%
learning yeah you know having like like
generative<00:15:26.290><c> adversarial</c><00:15:26.740><c> feedback</c><00:15:27.579><c> and</c>

00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:27.819 align:start position:0%
generative adversarial feedback and
 

00:15:27.819 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
generative adversarial feedback and
things<00:15:27.879><c> like</c><00:15:28.059><c> that</c><00:15:28.209><c> we</c><00:15:28.689><c> can</c><00:15:28.809><c> do</c><00:15:28.929><c> much</c><00:15:29.169><c> better</c>

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:29.950 align:start position:0%
things like that we can do much better
 

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
things like that we can do much better
and<00:15:30.070><c> even</c><00:15:30.339><c> we</c><00:15:30.519><c> have</c><00:15:30.670><c> some</c><00:15:30.880><c> stuff</c><00:15:31.329><c> that</c><00:15:31.420><c> we</c>

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:31.510 align:start position:0%
and even we have some stuff that we
 

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
and even we have some stuff that we
haven't<00:15:31.630><c> released</c><00:15:31.870><c> yet</c><00:15:32.079><c> that</c><00:15:32.170><c> I</c><00:15:32.200><c> think</c><00:15:32.350><c> is</c>

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:32.410 align:start position:0%
haven't released yet that I think is
 

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.829 align:start position:0%
haven't released yet that I think is
better<00:15:32.790><c> but</c><00:15:33.790><c> yeah</c><00:15:33.970><c> I</c><00:15:34.000><c> think</c><00:15:34.060><c> as</c><00:15:34.450><c> we</c><00:15:34.570><c> make</c><00:15:34.720><c> it</c>

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:34.839 align:start position:0%
better but yeah I think as we make it
 

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
better but yeah I think as we make it
better<00:15:35.019><c> it'll</c><00:15:35.380><c> be</c><00:15:35.589><c> more</c><00:15:35.829><c> of</c><00:15:36.010><c> a</c><00:15:36.149><c> this</c><00:15:37.149><c> models</c>

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:37.570 align:start position:0%
better it'll be more of a this models
 

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.910 align:start position:0%
better it'll be more of a this models
going<00:15:37.660><c> to</c><00:15:37.779><c> give</c><00:15:37.899><c> me</c><00:15:38.019><c> some</c><00:15:38.200><c> more</c><00:15:38.290><c> ideas</c><00:15:38.440><c> from</c>

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
going to give me some more ideas from

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.230 align:start position:0%

for<00:22:08.529><c> you</c><00:22:08.679><c> but</c><00:22:08.919><c> that's</c><00:22:09.070><c> not</c><00:22:09.190><c> necessarily</c>

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:10.309 align:start position:0%
for you but that's not necessarily
 

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:11.950 align:start position:0%
for you but that's not necessarily
so<00:22:10.429><c> painting</c><00:22:10.759><c> correct</c><00:22:11.149><c> early</c><00:22:11.749><c> saying</c>

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%

haven't
yeah<00:28:58.420><c> and</c><00:28:58.870><c> I</c><00:28:58.930><c> think</c><00:28:59.400><c> there's</c><00:29:00.400><c> a</c><00:29:00.490><c> couple</c><00:29:00.700><c> of</c>

yeah and I think there's a couple of
 

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think there's a couple of
levels<00:29:01.000><c> there</c><00:29:01.420><c> I</c><00:29:01.840><c> think</c><00:29:02.740><c> you</c><00:29:02.830><c> lose</c><00:29:03.040><c> that</c><00:29:03.250><c> if</c>

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:03.370 align:start position:0%
levels there I think you lose that if
 

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.590 align:start position:0%
levels there I think you lose that if
what<00:29:03.670><c> you're</c><00:29:03.790><c> just</c><00:29:03.940><c> doing</c><00:29:04.150><c> is</c><00:29:04.240><c> pushing</c><00:29:04.420><c> a</c>

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
what you're just doing is pushing a
 

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.530 align:start position:0%
what you're just doing is pushing a
button<00:29:04.900><c> and</c><00:29:05.050><c> like</c><00:29:05.680><c> so</c><00:29:06.100><c> I</c><00:29:06.400><c> think</c><00:29:07.180><c> this</c><00:29:07.390><c> is</c>

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:07.540 align:start position:0%

that's<00:32:53.510><c> part</c><00:32:53.690><c> so</c><00:32:54.110><c> another</c><00:32:54.620><c> way</c><00:32:54.800><c> to</c><00:32:54.830><c> do</c><00:32:55.010><c> this</c><00:32:55.190><c> is</c>

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:55.460 align:start position:0%
that's part so another way to do this is
 

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's part so another way to do this is
to<00:32:55.850><c> use</c><00:32:55.970><c> reinforcement</c><00:32:56.240><c> learning</c><00:32:56.630><c> yes</c><00:32:57.140><c> and</c>

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:57.530 align:start position:0%
to use reinforcement learning yes and
 

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.370 align:start position:0%

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:00.380 align:start position:0%

happy just listening to the stuff that's
now<00:38:06.609><c> easy</c><00:38:06.880><c> right</c><00:38:07.390><c> then</c><00:38:07.960><c> yeah</c><00:38:08.200><c> it's</c><00:38:08.440><c> a</c><00:38:08.500><c> problem</c>

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:08.650 align:start position:0%
now easy right then yeah it's a problem
 

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:09.810 align:start position:0%
now easy right then yeah it's a problem
solves<00:38:09.160><c> and</c><00:38:09.250><c> we'll</c><00:38:09.339><c> be</c><00:38:09.400><c> able</c><00:38:09.460><c> to</c><00:38:09.580><c> generate</c>

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:09.820 align:start position:0%
solves and we'll be able to generate
 

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.089 align:start position:0%
solves and we'll be able to generate
lots<00:38:10.030><c> of</c><00:38:10.150><c> it</c><00:38:10.330><c> but</c><00:38:10.839><c> then</c><00:38:11.020><c> what</c><00:38:11.530><c> people</c><00:38:11.650><c> tend</c><00:38:11.980><c> to</c>

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:12.099 align:start position:0%
lots of it but then what people tend to
 

00:38:12.099 --> 00:38:13.710 align:start position:0%
lots of it but then what people tend to
do<00:38:12.280><c> is</c><00:38:12.609><c> go</c><00:38:12.820><c> look</c><00:38:13.000><c> for</c><00:38:13.030><c> something</c><00:38:13.270><c> else</c><00:38:13.420><c> hard</c>

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
do is go look for something else hard
 

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.690 align:start position:0%
do is go look for something else hard
right<00:38:14.230><c> it's</c><00:38:14.830><c> like</c><00:38:14.980><c> the</c><00:38:15.250><c> drum</c><00:38:15.609><c> machine</c>

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:15.700 align:start position:0%
right it's like the drum machine
 

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.430 align:start position:0%
right it's like the drum machine
argument<00:38:16.210><c> so</c><00:38:16.359><c> you</c><00:38:16.420><c> solved</c><00:38:16.869><c> that</c><00:38:16.930><c> you</c><00:38:17.200><c> solve</c>

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
argument so you solved that you solve
 

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
argument so you solved that you solve
the<00:38:17.589><c> metronomic</c><00:38:18.480><c> you</c><00:38:19.480><c> sell</c><00:38:19.750><c> you</c><00:38:20.170><c> solve</c><00:38:20.470><c> the</c>

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:20.650 align:start position:0%
the metronomic you sell you solve the
 

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
the metronomic you sell you solve the
metronomic<00:38:21.010><c> you</c><00:38:21.640><c> know</c><00:38:21.760><c> beat</c><00:38:22.210><c> problem</c><00:38:22.750><c> and</c>

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:22.990 align:start position:0%
metronomic you know beat problem and
 

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
metronomic you know beat problem and
then<00:38:23.500><c> what</c><00:38:23.619><c> you</c><00:38:23.710><c> actually</c><00:38:23.980><c> find</c><00:38:24.160><c> is</c><00:38:24.339><c> that</c>

00:38:24.359 --> 00:38:24.369 align:start position:0%
then what you actually find is that
 

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:26.310 align:start position:0%
then what you actually find is that

break it this is how we're going to
 

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
break it this is how we're going to
retrain<00:38:59.320><c> ourselves</c><00:38:59.470><c> yeah</c><00:39:00.400><c> it</c><00:39:00.580><c> can</c><00:39:00.730><c> learn</c><00:39:00.910><c> so</c>

00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:01.089 align:start position:0%
retrain ourselves yeah it can learn so
 

00:39:01.089 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
retrain ourselves yeah it can learn so
fast<00:39:01.270><c> that</c><00:39:01.540><c> it's</c><00:39:01.690><c> like</c><00:39:01.810><c> okay</c><00:39:02.080><c> now</c><00:39:02.200><c> I</c><00:39:02.230><c> can</c><00:39:02.440><c> do</c>

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:02.530 align:start position:0%
fast that it's like okay now I can do
 

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:05.579 align:start position:0%

very he really cared about time in a way
and<00:40:36.820><c> and</c><00:40:37.060><c> so</c><00:40:37.570><c> like</c><00:40:37.720><c> if</c><00:40:37.960><c> you</c><00:40:38.170><c> if</c><00:40:38.470><c> the</c><00:40:39.070><c> way</c><00:40:39.190><c> that</c>

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:39.340 align:start position:0%

and and so like if you if the way that
you're<00:40:39.430><c> thinking</c><00:40:39.460><c> about</c><00:40:39.820><c> music</c><00:40:40.300><c> and</c>

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:40.420 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about music and
 

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.330 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about music and

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:42.340 align:start position:0%
composition is really really caring

about kind of local stuff right we're
 

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.230 align:start position:0%
about kind of local stuff right we're
very<00:40:44.800><c> very</c><00:40:45.010><c> interesting</c><00:40:45.430><c> if</c><00:40:45.550><c> you</c><00:40:45.610><c> had</c><00:40:45.760><c> a</c><00:40:45.790><c> model</c>

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
very very interesting if you had a model
 

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
very very interesting if you had a model

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:48.910 align:start position:0%
that would handle for you some of the
 

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
that would handle for you some of the

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:50.650 align:start position:0%
decisions that you would make for longer
 

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.350 align:start position:0%
decisions that you would make for longer
time<00:40:50.830><c> scale</c><00:40:51.040><c> things</c><00:40:51.310><c> like</c><00:40:51.520><c> like</c><00:40:51.880><c> when</c><00:40:52.180><c> do</c>

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
time scale things like like when do
 

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.090 align:start position:0%
time scale things like like when do
chord<00:40:52.600><c> changes</c><00:40:52.930><c> happen</c><00:40:53.260><c> right</c><00:40:53.440><c> so</c><00:40:53.650><c> like</c>

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:54.100 align:start position:0%
chord changes happen right so like
 

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
chord changes happen right so like
usually<00:40:54.700><c> it's</c><00:40:54.820><c> the</c><00:40:54.880><c> other</c><00:40:54.940><c> way</c><00:40:55.210><c> around</c><00:40:55.240><c> you</c>

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:55.690 align:start position:0%
usually it's the other way around you
 

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:56.850 align:start position:0%
usually it's the other way around you
have<00:40:55.780><c> these</c><00:40:56.050><c> AI</c><00:40:56.230><c> you</c><00:40:56.380><c> know</c><00:40:56.590><c> machine</c><00:40:56.800><c> learning</c>

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:56.860 align:start position:0%
have these AI you know machine learning
 

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.410 align:start position:0%
have these AI you know machine learning
models<00:40:57.250><c> can</c><00:40:57.370><c> handle</c><00:40:57.610><c> local</c><00:40:57.910><c> texture</c><00:40:58.180><c> but</c><00:40:58.300><c> you</c>

00:40:58.410 --> 00:40:58.420 align:start position:0%
models can handle local texture but you
 

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.970 align:start position:0%
models can handle local texture but you
have<00:40:58.570><c> to</c><00:40:58.690><c> have</c><00:40:59.230><c> to</c><00:40:59.350><c> decide</c><00:40:59.560><c> that</c><00:40:59.680><c> so</c><00:41:00.810><c> yeah</c><00:41:01.980><c> my</c>

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:02.980 align:start position:0%
have to have to decide that so yeah my
 

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.410 align:start position:0%
have to have to decide that so yeah my
point<00:41:03.190><c> is</c><00:41:03.250><c> if</c><00:41:03.340><c> we</c><00:41:03.610><c> get</c><00:41:03.760><c> to</c><00:41:03.910><c> models</c><00:41:04.210><c> that</c><00:41:04.330><c> can</c>

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:04.420 align:start position:0%
point is if we get to models that can
 

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
point is if we get to models that can
handle<00:41:04.570><c> longer</c><00:41:04.930><c> structure</c><00:41:05.230><c> and</c><00:41:05.380><c> nested</c>

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:05.650 align:start position:0%
handle longer structure and nested
 

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.050 align:start position:0%
handle longer structure and nested
structure<00:41:06.010><c> we'll</c><00:41:06.160><c> have</c><00:41:06.280><c> a</c><00:41:06.310><c> lot</c><00:41:06.490><c> more</c><00:41:06.520><c> ways</c><00:41:06.880><c> in</c>

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:07.060 align:start position:0%
structure we'll have a lot more ways in
 

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.550 align:start position:0%

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.230 align:start position:0%
hard to understand this creative coding
thing<00:41:56.860><c> like</c><00:41:57.130><c> that's</c><00:41:57.340><c> just</c><00:41:57.550><c> I</c><00:41:57.730><c> worked</c><00:41:57.910><c> on</c><00:41:58.030><c> I've</c>

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
thing like that's just I worked on I've
 

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
thing like that's just I worked on I've
a<00:41:58.480><c> lot</c><00:41:58.750><c> of</c><00:41:58.840><c> it's</c><00:41:58.960><c> just</c><00:41:59.110><c> like</c><00:41:59.230><c> I'll</c><00:41:59.470><c> start</c><00:41:59.770><c> and</c>

00:41:59.940 --> 00:41:59.950 align:start position:0%
a lot of it's just like I'll start and
 

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of it's just like I'll start and
then<00:41:59.980><c> I'll</c><00:42:00.130><c> get</c><00:42:00.250><c> distracted</c>

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:01.290 align:start position:0%
then I'll get distracted
 

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.890 align:start position:0%
then I'll get distracted
but<00:42:02.010><c> yeah</c><00:42:03.000><c> so</c><00:42:03.150><c> that's</c><00:42:03.270><c> sort</c><00:42:03.450><c> of</c><00:42:03.480><c> the</c><00:42:03.570><c> level</c><00:42:03.720><c> of</c>

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
but yeah so that's sort of the level of
 

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:05.060 align:start position:0%
but yeah so that's sort of the level of
my<00:42:03.990><c> creative</c><00:42:04.260><c> output</c><00:42:04.410><c> I'm</c><00:42:04.590><c> afraid</c>

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.070 align:start position:0%
my creative output I'm afraid
 

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.590 align:start position:0%
my creative output I'm afraid
well<00:42:05.520><c> the</c><00:42:05.610><c> creative</c><00:42:05.910><c> coding</c><00:42:06.120><c> van</c><00:42:06.360><c> it's</c>

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
well the creative coding van it's
 

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.260 align:start position:0%
well the creative coding van it's
seemingly<00:42:07.230><c> I</c><00:42:07.560><c> don't</c><00:42:08.310><c> know</c><00:42:08.400><c> so</c><00:42:08.850><c> many</c><00:42:09.060><c> people</c>

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:09.270 align:start position:0%
seemingly I don't know so many people
 

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
seemingly I don't know so many people
are<00:42:09.360><c> looking</c><00:42:09.480><c> for</c><00:42:09.810><c> it</c><00:42:09.900><c> in</c><00:42:10.020><c> every</c><00:42:10.140><c> venue</c><00:42:10.560><c> and</c>

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:10.890 align:start position:0%
are looking for it in every venue and
 

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:13.310 align:start position:0%
are looking for it in every venue and
it's<00:42:11.100><c> so</c><00:42:11.550><c> difficult</c><00:42:11.760><c> to</c><00:42:12.000><c> find</c><00:42:12.180><c> people</c><00:42:12.540><c> they're</c>

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's so difficult to find people they're
 

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.260 align:start position:0%
it's so difficult to find people they're
just<00:42:13.350><c> kind</c><00:42:13.680><c> of</c><00:42:13.710><c> like</c><00:42:13.770><c> one</c><00:42:14.010><c> offs</c><00:42:14.190><c> now</c><00:42:14.550><c> yeah</c><00:42:15.240><c> I</c>

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:15.270 align:start position:0%
just kind of like one offs now yeah I
 

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.300 align:start position:0%
just kind of like one offs now yeah I
think<00:42:15.360><c> that's</c><00:42:15.630><c> right</c><00:42:15.840><c> it's</c><00:42:16.590><c> so</c><00:42:16.800><c> it's</c><00:42:17.070><c> so</c><00:42:17.160><c> hard</c>

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:17.310 align:start position:0%
think that's right it's so it's so hard
 

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.750 align:start position:0%
think that's right it's so it's so hard
to<00:42:17.640><c> have</c><00:42:17.820><c> the</c><00:42:18.000><c> right</c><00:42:18.180><c> I</c><00:42:18.390><c> think</c><00:42:19.080><c> maybe</c><00:42:19.640><c> you</c><00:42:20.640><c> know</c>

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
to have the right I think maybe you know
 

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
to have the right I think maybe you know
maybe<00:42:21.750><c> we</c><00:42:21.870><c> need</c><00:42:21.990><c> the</c><00:42:22.050><c> Garage</c><00:42:22.230><c> Band</c><00:42:22.440><c> of</c><00:42:22.680><c> this</c>

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:22.890 align:start position:0%
maybe we need the Garage Band of this
 

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:23.990 align:start position:0%
maybe we need the Garage Band of this
like<00:42:23.160><c> you</c><00:42:23.250><c> know</c><00:42:23.280><c> we</c><00:42:23.430><c> need</c><00:42:23.550><c> to</c><00:42:23.640><c> have</c><00:42:23.760><c> like</c>

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
like you know we need to have like
 

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
like you know we need to have like
something<00:42:24.300><c> that's</c><00:42:24.570><c> so</c><00:42:24.780><c> well</c><00:42:25.020><c> put</c><00:42:25.260><c> together</c>

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:25.410 align:start position:0%
something that's so well put together
 

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.020 align:start position:0%
something that's so well put together
but<00:42:26.220><c> it</c><00:42:26.280><c> makes</c><00:42:26.400><c> it</c><00:42:26.520><c> easy</c><00:42:26.640><c> for</c><00:42:26.850><c> a</c><00:42:26.880><c> whole</c>

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.030 align:start position:0%
but it makes it easy for a whole
 

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:28.460 align:start position:0%
but it makes it easy for a whole
generation<00:42:27.630><c> of</c><00:42:27.690><c> people</c><00:42:27.750><c> to</c><00:42:27.990><c> jump</c><00:42:28.140><c> in</c><00:42:28.260><c> and</c><00:42:28.410><c> try</c>
