00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:14.300 align:start position:0%
trying to find product market fit yeah I
 

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.300 align:start position:0%
trying to find product market fit yeah I
think<00:11:14.750><c> almost</c><00:11:15.410><c> everything</c><00:11:15.860><c> you</c><00:11:16.070><c> can</c><00:11:16.220><c> imagine</c>

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:16.310 align:start position:0%
think almost everything you can imagine
 

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:19.569 align:start position:0%
think almost everything you can imagine
can<00:11:16.850><c> go</c><00:11:16.970><c> wrong</c><00:11:17.620><c> and</c><00:11:18.620><c> so</c><00:11:19.100><c> if</c><00:11:19.160><c> you</c><00:11:19.250><c> don't</c><00:11:19.430><c> have</c>

00:11:19.569 --> 00:11:19.579 align:start position:0%
can go wrong and so if you don't have
 

00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
can go wrong and so if you don't have
product<00:11:19.760><c> market</c><00:11:20.120><c> fit</c><00:11:20.149><c> that</c><00:11:20.420><c> may</c><00:11:20.600><c> or</c><00:11:20.690><c> may</c><00:11:20.720><c> not</c>

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:20.810 align:start position:0%
product market fit that may or may not
 

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
product market fit that may or may not
derail<00:11:21.110><c> the</c><00:11:21.290><c> company</c><00:11:21.589><c> fair</c><00:11:21.709><c> product</c><00:11:22.010><c> market</c>

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.250 align:start position:0%
derail the company fair product market
 

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.949 align:start position:0%
derail the company fair product market
fit<00:11:22.279><c> then</c><00:11:22.579><c> you</c><00:11:22.610><c> know</c><00:11:22.970><c> it</c><00:11:23.209><c> kind</c><00:11:23.510><c> of</c><00:11:23.600><c> matters</c>

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%

00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:25.569 align:start position:0%

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:38.990 align:start position:0%
for locations and then we quickly
 

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.389 align:start position:0%
for locations and then we quickly
morphed<00:11:39.380><c> it</c><00:11:39.529><c> into</c><00:11:39.620><c> an</c><00:11:39.949><c> infrastructure</c>

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
morphed it into an infrastructure

morphed it into an infrastructure

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
to enable geolocation application so
 

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.090 align:start position:0%
to enable geolocation application so

this was before there was a big wave of

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.250 align:start position:0%
to aggregate content and we'd built out
 

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.829 align:start position:0%
to aggregate content and we'd built out
very<00:11:58.519><c> deep</c><00:11:58.699><c> infrastructure</c><00:11:59.329><c> for</c><00:11:59.449><c> that</c><00:11:59.510><c> and</c>

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
very deep infrastructure for that and
 

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:00.850 align:start position:0%
very deep infrastructure for that and
then<00:11:59.930><c> we</c><00:11:59.990><c> decided</c><00:12:00.290><c> that</c><00:12:00.440><c> really</c><00:12:00.560><c> what</c><00:12:00.769><c> we</c>

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:00.860 align:start position:0%
then we decided that really what we

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:01.790 align:start position:0%

should be doing is selling the

somebody else and then everybody kind of
 

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.610 align:start position:0%
somebody else and then everybody kind of

meeting with a lot Gil I think you make
it<00:33:41.520><c> sound</c><00:33:41.640><c> like</c><00:33:41.730><c> that's</c><00:33:41.940><c> a</c><00:33:42.230><c> valuable</c><00:33:43.230><c> thing</c>

it sound like that's a valuable thing

it sound like that's a valuable thing
but<00:33:44.400><c> I</c><00:33:44.430><c> think</c><00:33:44.880><c> well</c><00:33:45.810><c> it</c><00:33:46.080><c> depends</c><00:33:46.560><c> whether</c>

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:47.070 align:start position:0%
but I think well it depends whether
 

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
but I think well it depends whether
those<00:33:47.850><c> companies</c><00:33:48.330><c> that</c><00:33:48.420><c> you</c><00:33:48.600><c> invested</c><00:33:49.050><c> in</c>

those companies that you invested in
 

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
those companies that you invested in

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:25.530 align:start position:0%

sales and it could be that it's flat and
that's<00:43:25.680><c> fine</c><00:43:25.920><c> right</c>

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:26.820 align:start position:0%

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
market first investment strategy so how
 

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.349 align:start position:0%
market first investment strategy so how
did<00:44:32.750><c> you</c><00:44:32.900><c> evaluate</c><00:44:33.650><c> an</c><00:44:34.010><c> obvious</c><00:44:34.790><c> market</c><00:44:35.210><c> like</c>

00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
did you evaluate an obvious market like
 

00:44:35.359 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
did you evaluate an obvious market like
that<00:44:35.510><c> IBM</c><00:44:35.840><c> need</c><00:44:36.050><c> back</c><00:44:36.260><c> in</c><00:44:36.550><c> 2010</c><00:44:37.550><c> how</c><00:44:37.970><c> did</c><00:44:38.150><c> you</c>

00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
so<00:44:41.869><c> the</c><00:44:41.990><c> question</c><00:44:42.290><c> is</c><00:44:42.410><c> about</c><00:44:42.760><c> market</c>

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
so the question is about market
 

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.390 align:start position:0%
so the question is about market
opportunities<00:44:44.359><c> since</c><00:44:44.960><c> a</c><00:44:45.140><c> lot</c><00:44:45.290><c> cares</c><00:44:46.100><c> most</c>

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities since a lot cares most
 

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.010 align:start position:0%
opportunities since a lot cares most
about<00:44:46.670><c> that</c><00:44:47.060><c> how</c><00:44:47.420><c> do</c><00:44:47.480><c> you</c><00:44:47.720><c> evaluate</c>

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:48.020 align:start position:0%
about that how do you evaluate
 

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.830 align:start position:0%
about that how do you evaluate
opportunities<00:44:48.590><c> that</c><00:44:49.130><c> are</c><00:44:49.250><c> non</c><00:44:49.400><c> obvious</c><00:44:49.940><c> like</c>

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are non obvious like
 

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.290 align:start position:0%
opportunities that are non obvious like
you're<00:44:51.020><c> being</c><00:44:51.170><c> B</c><00:44:51.350><c> yeah</c><00:44:51.740><c> so</c><00:44:52.609><c> I</c><00:44:52.640><c> invested</c><00:44:53.180><c> in</c>

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:53.300 align:start position:0%
you're being B yeah so I invested in
 

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.420 align:start position:0%
you're being B yeah so I invested in
their<00:44:53.420><c> a</c><00:44:53.450><c> versus</c><00:44:54.109><c> her</c><00:44:54.230><c> seed</c><00:44:54.470><c> I'm</c><00:44:55.040><c> guessing</c><00:44:55.340><c> the</c>

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
their a versus her seed I'm guessing the
 

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:57.490 align:start position:0%
their a versus her seed I'm guessing the
seed<00:44:55.580><c> was</c><00:44:55.730><c> harder</c><00:44:56.030><c> I</c><00:44:56.240><c> think</c><00:44:56.600><c> at</c><00:44:56.900><c> their</c><00:44:57.050><c> a</c><00:44:57.080><c> they</c>

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:57.500 align:start position:0%
seed was harder I think at their a they
 

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.470 align:start position:0%
seed was harder I think at their a they
had<00:44:57.710><c> pretty</c><00:44:58.580><c> clear</c><00:44:58.760><c> traction</c><00:44:59.150><c> I</c><00:44:59.270><c> mean</c><00:44:59.420><c> they</c>

00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
had pretty clear traction I mean they
 

00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.870 align:start position:0%
had pretty clear traction I mean they
were<00:44:59.570><c> growing</c><00:44:59.750><c> at</c><00:44:59.840><c> a</c><00:44:59.900><c> good</c><00:45:00.050><c> clip</c><00:45:00.280><c> and</c><00:45:01.280><c> then</c><00:45:01.700><c> the</c>

00:47:32.539 --> 00:47:34.839 align:start position:0%
great quote which if he had to tell
startup<00:47:33.260><c> founders</c><00:47:33.559><c> one</c><00:47:33.740><c> thing</c><00:47:33.980><c> I</c><00:47:34.280><c> think</c><00:47:34.670><c> he</c>

00:47:34.839 --> 00:47:34.849 align:start position:0%
startup founders one thing I think he
 

00:47:34.849 --> 00:47:36.010 align:start position:0%
startup founders one thing I think he
says<00:47:35.030><c> that</c><00:47:35.180><c> you</c><00:47:35.270><c> would</c><00:47:35.510><c> tell</c><00:47:35.660><c> him</c><00:47:35.750><c> to</c><00:47:35.809><c> raise</c>

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
says that you would tell him to raise
prices<00:47:36.260><c> and</c><00:47:36.730><c> so</c><00:47:37.730><c> I</c><00:47:38.450><c> think</c><00:47:39.020><c> in</c><00:47:39.349><c> general</c>

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:39.910 align:start position:0%

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:42.039 align:start position:0%
prices and so I think in general
especially<00:47:40.910><c> technology</c><00:47:41.030><c> driven</c><00:47:41.510><c> companies</c>

00:47:42.039 --> 00:47:42.049 align:start position:0%
especially technology driven companies
 

00:47:42.049 --> 00:47:44.500 align:start position:0%
especially technology driven companies
tend<00:47:42.680><c> to</c><00:47:42.740><c> really</c><00:47:43.339><c> under</c><00:47:43.609><c> price</c><00:47:43.849><c> their</c><00:47:44.089><c> product</c>

tend to really under price their product
 

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:46.089 align:start position:0%
tend to really under price their product

00:47:46.089 --> 00:47:46.099 align:start position:0%
under the belief that if they price it
 

00:47:46.099 --> 00:47:48.069 align:start position:0%
under the belief that if they price it
really<00:47:46.250><c> low</c><00:47:46.609><c> it'll</c><00:47:47.329><c> get</c><00:47:47.480><c> them</c><00:47:47.599><c> more</c><00:47:47.750><c> market</c>

00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
really low it'll get them more market
 

00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%

share<00:47:48.109><c> more</c><00:47:48.470><c> rapidly</c><00:47:48.829><c> and</c><00:47:49.130><c> therefore</c><00:47:49.460><c> they'll</c>

00:47:49.599 --> 00:47:49.609 align:start position:0%
share more rapidly and therefore they'll
 

00:47:49.609 --> 00:47:51.490 align:start position:0%

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:51.500 align:start position:0%
win the market when in reality they've
 

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.140 align:start position:0%
win the market when in reality they've

raise them and it's very hard to raise
 

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:00.220 align:start position:0%
raise them and it's very hard to raise
them<00:47:58.880><c> I</c><00:47:59.119><c> do</c><00:47:59.420><c> think</c><00:47:59.720><c> that</c><00:47:59.779><c> people</c><00:48:00.049><c> also</c>

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
