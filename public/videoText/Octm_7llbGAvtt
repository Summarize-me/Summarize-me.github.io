00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:23.390 align:start position:0%
that was a hard process but I think the

that was a hard process but I think the

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:53.210 align:start position:0%
so to the point and the idea of papi and
 

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
so to the point and the idea of papi and
so<00:10:54.020><c> now</c><00:10:54.230><c> if</c><00:10:55.130><c> we</c><00:10:55.280><c> think</c><00:10:55.490><c> about</c><00:10:55.670><c> that</c><00:10:55.910><c> first</c>

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:56.210 align:start position:0%
so now if we think about that first

with my family and my husband to go and
 

00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:31.340 align:start position:0%
with my family and my husband to go and
do<00:11:28.680><c> this</c><00:11:28.920><c> and</c><00:11:29.189><c> so</c><00:11:29.759><c> I</c><00:11:29.790><c> guess</c><00:11:30.240><c> the</c><00:11:30.959><c> point</c><00:11:31.170><c> is</c>

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
do this and so I guess the point is
 

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.319 align:start position:0%
do this and so I guess the point is
there<00:11:31.680><c> is</c><00:11:31.709><c> that</c><00:11:32.069><c> I</c><00:11:32.100><c> was</c><00:11:32.399><c> if</c><00:11:32.639><c> it</c><00:11:33.000><c> was</c><00:11:33.149><c> already</c>

00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:33.329 align:start position:0%
there is that I was if it was already
 

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:35.660 align:start position:0%
there is that I was if it was already

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:37.980 align:start position:0%

00:13:38.299 --> 00:13:38.309 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly and then the other thing
 

00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly and then the other thing
is<00:13:38.339><c> that</c><00:13:39.499><c> having</c><00:13:40.550><c> having</c><00:13:41.550><c> a</c><00:13:41.730><c> goal</c><00:13:41.970><c> and</c><00:13:42.329><c> then</c>

actually struck a nerve of something
 

00:13:46.529 --> 00:13:48.139 align:start position:0%
actually struck a nerve of something

that people really needed and wanted
we<00:13:48.509><c> ended</c><00:13:48.629><c> up</c><00:13:48.689><c> growing</c><00:13:48.930><c> faster</c><00:13:49.379><c> than</c><00:13:49.410><c> the</c><00:13:49.559><c> 10%</c>

00:13:49.819 --> 00:13:49.829 align:start position:0%
we ended up growing faster than the 10%

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:51.779 align:start position:0%

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:53.509 align:start position:0%
in those early days so instead of five
we<00:13:51.959><c> actually</c><00:13:52.199><c> ended</c><00:13:52.350><c> up</c><00:13:52.439><c> at</c><00:13:52.589><c> six</c><00:13:52.860><c> and</c><00:13:53.100><c> then</c><00:13:53.279><c> so</c>

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
we actually ended up at six and then so
 

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:56.290 align:start position:0%
we actually ended up at six and then so
on<00:13:53.670><c> so</c><00:13:53.970><c> forth</c><00:13:54.240><c> and</c><00:13:54.480><c> that</c><00:13:54.540><c> is</c><00:13:55.230><c> an</c><00:13:55.589><c> incredible</c>

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:05.370 align:start position:0%
should go give it another shot

and so the four week test for me did a

and so the four week test for me did a

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
couple of things it reduced the risk for

was<00:15:39.730><c> not</c><00:15:39.910><c> only</c><00:15:40.060><c> time</c><00:15:40.390><c> to</c><00:15:40.690><c> keep</c><00:15:40.839><c> on</c><00:15:40.990><c> going</c><00:15:41.290><c> but</c><00:15:42.010><c> I</c>

00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:42.459 align:start position:0%
was not only time to keep on going but I
 

00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:44.970 align:start position:0%
was not only time to keep on going but I

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:44.980 align:start position:0%
quickly realized what my next problem I
 

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
quickly realized what my next problem I

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:46.990 align:start position:0%
had to solve and that was I had to find
 

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
had to solve and that was I had to find

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:49.510 align:start position:0%
a technical co-founder and that made

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
that pretty apparent and so I continued
 

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.910 align:start position:0%
that pretty apparent and so I continued

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
to keep everything going and growing to
 

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.430 align:start position:0%
to keep everything going and growing to

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
be able to buy that additional time but
 

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
be able to buy that additional time but
I<00:15:56.470><c> quickly</c><00:15:56.770><c> turned</c><00:15:57.070><c> my</c><00:15:57.250><c> attention</c><00:15:57.370><c> to</c><00:15:57.760><c> finding</c>

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:58.089 align:start position:0%
I quickly turned my attention to finding
 

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:00.870 align:start position:0%

pause on this thing because I think
 

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.410 align:start position:0%
pause on this thing because I think

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:42.220 align:start position:0%

on<00:17:42.370><c> one</c><00:17:42.550><c> day</c><00:17:42.700><c> and</c><00:17:42.850><c> at</c><00:17:42.940><c> noon</c><00:17:43.150><c> the</c><00:17:43.540><c> lowest</c><00:17:43.840><c> low</c>

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:46.630 align:start position:0%
and so you need sort of that partnership
 

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
and so you need sort of that partnership
to<00:17:46.929><c> even</c><00:17:47.169><c> that</c><00:17:47.290><c> out</c>

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:47.830 align:start position:0%

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
to even that out
and<00:17:48.280><c> so</c><00:17:48.640><c> it</c><00:17:49.210><c> took</c><00:17:49.330><c> a</c><00:17:49.420><c> couple</c><00:17:49.660><c> months</c><00:17:49.810><c> talked</c><00:17:50.560><c> to</c>
