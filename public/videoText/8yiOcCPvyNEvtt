00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
mid-batch and so
 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.070 align:start position:0%
mid-batch and so
that<00:05:03.120><c> means</c><00:05:03.280><c> they've</c><00:05:03.520><c> been</c><00:05:03.600><c> working</c><00:05:03.840><c> on</c><00:05:03.919><c> their</c>

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
that means they've been working on their
 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
that means they've been working on their
startup<00:05:04.400><c> like</c><00:05:04.560><c> a</c><00:05:04.639><c> negative</c><00:05:05.039><c> number</c><00:05:05.280><c> of</c><00:05:05.360><c> days</c>

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
startup like a negative number of days
 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.950 align:start position:0%
startup like a negative number of days
right<00:05:07.360><c> that</c><00:05:07.600><c> is</c><00:05:07.680><c> clearly</c><00:05:07.919><c> not</c><00:05:08.080><c> too</c><00:05:08.240><c> early</c><00:05:08.560><c> also</c>

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
right that is clearly not too early also
 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.990 align:start position:0%
right that is clearly not too early also
and<00:05:09.120><c> so</c><00:05:09.360><c> again</c><00:05:09.600><c> there's</c><00:05:09.759><c> this</c>

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
and so again there's this
 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.590 align:start position:0%
and so again there's this
there's<00:05:10.160><c> a</c><00:05:10.160><c> lot</c><00:05:10.320><c> of</c><00:05:10.479><c> ideas</c><00:05:10.800><c> around</c><00:05:11.039><c> there</c><00:05:11.440><c> that</c>

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ideas around there that
 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.270 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ideas around there that

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
like the right way to apply to yc is to
 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.790 align:start position:0%
like the right way to apply to yc is to

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
makes a good application because i think
 

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.069 align:start position:0%
makes a good application because i think
that<00:11:24.720><c> will</c><00:11:24.880><c> make</c><00:11:25.040><c> my</c><00:11:25.200><c> job</c><00:11:25.440><c> easier</c>

00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
that will make my job easier
 

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
that will make my job easier

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:05.269 align:start position:0%
great they got in right um and it's
because

00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.310 align:start position:0%
of an established software engineer
you<00:24:13.039><c> built</c><00:24:13.279><c> a</c><00:24:13.360><c> prototype</c><00:24:13.840><c> and</c><00:24:13.919><c> you</c><00:24:14.000><c> brought</c><00:24:14.159><c> it</c>

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
you built a prototype and you brought it
 

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.149 align:start position:0%
you built a prototype and you brought it

00:26:01.919 --> 00:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward and transparent
okay

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.269 align:start position:0%
okay
let's<00:26:03.840><c> talk</c><00:26:04.000><c> about</c><00:26:04.080><c> applying</c><00:26:04.400><c> more</c><00:26:04.559><c> than</c><00:26:04.720><c> once</c>

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
let's talk about applying more than once
 

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:07.750 align:start position:0%
let's talk about applying more than once
okay<00:26:05.760><c> about</c><00:26:06.000><c> a</c><00:26:06.159><c> third</c><00:26:06.480><c> of</c><00:26:06.720><c> last</c><00:26:06.960><c> batch</c>

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay about a third of last batch
 

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.430 align:start position:0%
okay about a third of last batch
were<00:26:07.919><c> companies</c><00:26:08.320><c> that</c><00:26:08.480><c> applied</c><00:26:09.039><c> already</c><00:26:09.360><c> in</c>

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
were companies that applied already in
 

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.110 align:start position:0%
were companies that applied already in
the<00:26:09.520><c> past</c><00:26:09.760><c> and</c><00:26:09.919><c> didn't</c><00:26:10.159><c> get</c><00:26:10.320><c> in</c>

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
the past and didn't get in
 

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.710 align:start position:0%
the past and didn't get in
and<00:26:11.279><c> so</c><00:26:11.679><c> the</c><00:26:11.840><c> reason</c><00:26:12.080><c> i</c><00:26:12.240><c> say</c><00:26:12.400><c> this</c><00:26:12.960><c> is</c>

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
and so the reason i say this is
 

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.190 align:start position:0%
and so the reason i say this is
it's<00:26:14.960><c> not</c><00:26:15.279><c> bad</c><00:26:15.600><c> to</c><00:26:15.760><c> apply</c><00:26:16.159><c> and</c><00:26:16.240><c> not</c><00:26:16.480><c> get</c><00:26:16.720><c> in</c>

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's not bad to apply and not get in
 

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.190 align:start position:0%
it's not bad to apply and not get in
that<00:26:17.360><c> doesn't</c><00:26:17.760><c> ruin</c><00:26:18.080><c> your</c><00:26:18.320><c> odds</c><00:26:18.640><c> if</c><00:26:18.799><c> anything</c>

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't ruin your odds if anything
 

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.909 align:start position:0%
that doesn't ruin your odds if anything
it<00:26:19.279><c> helps</c><00:26:19.600><c> you</c>

00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
it helps you
 

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:21.510 align:start position:0%
it helps you
the<00:26:20.000><c> way</c><00:26:20.240><c> it</c><00:26:20.320><c> helps</c><00:26:20.559><c> you</c><00:26:20.799><c> is</c><00:26:20.880><c> that</c><00:26:21.039><c> your</c><00:26:21.200><c> next</c>

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
the way it helps you is that your next
 

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.470 align:start position:0%
the way it helps you is that your next

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.029 align:start position:0%
to prepare for interviews
and<00:32:36.080><c> i</c><00:32:36.320><c> think</c><00:32:38.000><c> a</c><00:32:38.159><c> lot</c><00:32:38.320><c> of</c><00:32:38.480><c> it</c><00:32:38.559><c> is</c><00:32:38.640><c> a</c><00:32:38.720><c> little</c>

00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of it is a little
 

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:40.389 align:start position:0%
and i think a lot of it is a little
wrong

00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
wrong
 

00:32:40.399 --> 00:32:43.029 align:start position:0%

and<00:32:40.720><c> the</c><00:32:40.880><c> reason</c><00:32:41.200><c> it's</c><00:32:41.440><c> wrong</c><00:32:42.000><c> is</c><00:32:42.559><c> i</c><00:32:42.720><c> think</c><00:32:42.880><c> it</c>

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
and the reason it's wrong is i think it
 

00:32:43.039 --> 00:32:44.710 align:start position:0%
and the reason it's wrong is i think it
sets<00:32:43.279><c> up</c><00:32:43.360><c> the</c><00:32:43.440><c> mentality</c><00:32:44.080><c> that</c><00:32:44.240><c> a</c><00:32:44.320><c> yc</c>

um<00:33:08.320><c> and</c><00:33:09.360><c> i</c><00:33:09.519><c> think</c><00:33:09.760><c> it's</c><00:33:09.919><c> usually</c><00:33:10.240><c> people</c><00:33:10.399><c> that</c>

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
um and i think it's usually people that
 

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:11.830 align:start position:0%
um and i think it's usually people that

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
didn't get in that write that and so i
 

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.269 align:start position:0%
didn't get in that write that and so i
understand<00:33:12.159><c> how</c><00:33:12.320><c> i</c><00:33:12.399><c> can</c><00:33:12.480><c> feel</c><00:33:12.720><c> adversarial</c><00:33:13.200><c> if</c>

00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
