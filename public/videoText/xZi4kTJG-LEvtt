00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:55.650 align:start position:0%
think you discover a product market fit
 

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.890 align:start position:0%
think you discover a product market fit
from<00:40:55.920><c> the</c><00:40:55.980><c> nose</c><00:40:56.220><c> I</c><00:40:56.580><c> think</c><00:40:57.240><c> you</c><00:40:57.330><c> only</c><00:40:57.480><c> discover</c>

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
from the nose I think you only discover
 

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.609 align:start position:0%
from the nose I think you only discover
it<00:40:58.020><c> from</c><00:40:58.140><c> the</c><00:40:58.260><c> yeses</c>

00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
it from the yeses
 

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:00.830 align:start position:0%
it from the yeses
so<00:40:59.280><c> I</c><00:40:59.609><c> think</c><00:40:59.849><c> when</c><00:41:00.119><c> you</c><00:41:00.150><c> get</c><00:41:00.330><c> nose</c><00:41:00.540><c> there's</c><00:41:00.780><c> a</c>

00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I think when you get nose there's a
 

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:02.210 align:start position:0%
so I think when you get nose there's a
lot<00:41:00.990><c> of</c><00:41:01.109><c> reasons</c><00:41:01.410><c> people</c><00:41:01.470><c> could</c><00:41:01.830><c> give</c><00:41:01.950><c> me</c>
