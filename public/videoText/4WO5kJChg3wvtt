00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.110 align:start position:0%
software to make someone's website right
and<00:27:10.380><c> I</c><00:27:10.680><c> was</c><00:27:10.830><c> also</c><00:27:11.340><c> the</c><00:27:11.580><c> guy</c><00:27:11.670><c> who</c><00:27:11.700><c> wrote</c><00:27:12.090><c> the</c>

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
and I was also the guy who wrote the
 

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
and I was also the guy who wrote the
site<00:27:12.510><c> builder</c><00:27:12.900><c> and</c><00:27:13.110><c> so</c><00:27:13.500><c> I</c><00:27:13.530><c> would</c><00:27:13.710><c> be</c><00:27:13.740><c> using</c><00:27:14.040><c> and</c>

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:14.370 align:start position:0%
site builder and so I would be using and
 

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.660 align:start position:0%
site builder and so I would be using and
think<00:27:14.580><c> to</c><00:27:14.670><c> myself</c><00:27:14.790><c> this</c><00:27:15.510><c> is</c><00:27:15.660><c> inconvenient</c>

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:16.670 align:start position:0%
think to myself this is inconvenient
 

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
think to myself this is inconvenient
it's<00:27:17.670><c> like</c><00:27:17.850><c> going</c><00:27:18.420><c> in</c><00:27:18.870><c> the</c><00:27:19.020><c> middle</c><00:27:19.290><c> of</c>

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:19.410 align:start position:0%
it's like going in the middle of
