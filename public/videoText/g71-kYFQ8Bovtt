you applied during the main YC core
program<00:00:23.039><c> yeah</c><00:00:23.490><c> I</c><00:00:23.519><c> think</c><00:00:23.820><c> so</c><00:00:24.119><c> we</c><00:00:24.210><c> did</c><00:00:24.359><c> the</c>

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
program yeah I think so we did the
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 align:start position:0%
program yeah I think so we did the
fellowship<00:00:24.689><c> in</c><00:00:25.140><c> winter</c><00:00:25.590><c> of</c><00:00:25.619><c> 2016</c>

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 align:start position:0%
fellowship in winter of 2016
 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.330 align:start position:0%
fellowship in winter of 2016
huh<00:00:27.029><c> when</c><00:00:27.300><c> Kevin</c><00:00:27.510><c> Hale</c><00:00:27.750><c> was</c><00:00:27.960><c> running</c><00:00:28.230><c> it</c><00:00:28.380><c> and</c>

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
huh when Kevin Hale was running it and
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.810 align:start position:0%
huh when Kevin Hale was running it and
so<00:00:29.970><c> I</c><00:00:30.000><c> think</c><00:00:30.210><c> for</c><00:00:30.539><c> us</c><00:00:30.800><c> YC</c><00:00:31.800><c> fellowship</c><00:00:32.430><c> was</c><00:00:32.610><c> all</c>

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 align:start position:0%
so I think for us YC fellowship was all
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.420 align:start position:0%
so I think for us YC fellowship was all
about<00:00:33.120><c> like</c><00:00:33.840><c> figuring</c><00:00:34.290><c> out</c><00:00:34.500><c> product</c><00:00:35.160><c> market</c>

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 align:start position:0%
about like figuring out product market
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.340 align:start position:0%
about like figuring out product market
fit<00:00:35.460><c> and</c><00:00:35.940><c> like</c><00:00:36.329><c> figuring</c><00:00:36.690><c> out</c><00:00:36.780><c> what</c><00:00:36.960><c> we</c><00:00:37.079><c> were</c>

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 align:start position:0%
fit and like figuring out what we were
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
fit and like figuring out what we were
because<00:00:37.800><c> we</c><00:00:37.829><c> didn't</c><00:00:38.160><c> know</c><00:00:38.570><c> when</c><00:00:39.570><c> we</c><00:00:39.600><c> got</c><00:00:39.899><c> in</c><00:00:40.110><c> we</c>

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 align:start position:0%
because we didn't know when we got in we
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.530 align:start position:0%
because we didn't know when we got in we
were<00:00:40.410><c> basically</c><00:00:40.800><c> the</c><00:00:41.579><c> concept</c><00:00:42.059><c> was</c><00:00:42.210><c> this</c><00:00:42.360><c> like</c>

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
were basically the concept was this like
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.200 align:start position:0%

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
like the program in general basically
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.140 align:start position:0%
like the program in general basically
allowed<00:01:32.130><c> us</c><00:01:32.280><c> to</c><00:01:32.400><c> be</c><00:01:32.460><c> like</c><00:01:32.549><c> okay</c><00:01:32.790><c> this</c><00:01:32.970><c> isn't</c>

allowed us to be like okay this isn't
working<00:01:33.540><c> let's</c><00:01:33.750><c> try</c><00:01:34.680><c> it</c><00:01:34.740><c> like</c><00:01:34.860><c> literally</c><00:01:35.369><c> 15</c>

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 align:start position:0%
working let's try it like literally 15
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
working let's try it like literally 15
other<00:01:36.060><c> concepts</c><00:01:36.750><c> and</c><00:01:37.020><c> see</c><00:01:37.200><c> and</c><00:01:37.439><c> get</c><00:01:37.530><c> something</c>

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 align:start position:0%
other concepts and see and get something
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.030 align:start position:0%
other concepts and see and get something
with<00:01:38.340><c> some</c><00:01:38.700><c> momentum</c><00:01:39.210><c> and</c><00:01:39.479><c> go</c><00:01:39.689><c> with</c><00:01:39.840><c> that</c><00:01:40.040><c> and</c>

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
with some momentum and go with that and
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.590 align:start position:0%
with some momentum and go with that and
so<00:01:41.159><c> I</c><00:01:41.189><c> feel</c><00:01:41.400><c> like</c><00:01:41.430><c> we</c><00:01:41.610><c> basically</c><00:01:41.909><c> used</c><00:01:42.390><c> it</c><00:01:42.570><c> I</c>

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I feel like we basically used it I
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.289 align:start position:0%
so I feel like we basically used it I
think<00:01:42.780><c> was</c><00:01:42.869><c> two</c><00:01:43.079><c> months</c><00:01:43.229><c> that</c><00:01:43.530><c> program</c><00:01:43.890><c> and</c><00:01:44.130><c> we</c>

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 align:start position:0%
think was two months that program and we
 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.910 align:start position:0%
think was two months that program and we
were<00:01:45.299><c> just</c><00:01:45.509><c> ran</c><00:01:45.750><c> like</c><00:01:45.960><c> experiments</c><00:01:46.649><c> every</c>

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 align:start position:0%

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.499 align:start position:0%
were just ran like experiments every
week<00:01:47.070><c> so</c><00:01:47.310><c> we're</c><00:01:47.430><c> like</c><00:01:47.579><c> okay</c><00:01:47.729><c> what</c><00:01:47.939><c> if</c><00:01:48.030><c> we</c><00:01:48.060><c> and</c>

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
I think we had enough traction and data
 

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.090 align:start position:0%
I think we had enough traction and data
to<00:19:25.929><c> show</c><00:19:26.110><c> that</c><00:19:26.320><c> like</c><00:19:26.470><c> okay</c><00:19:26.710><c> the</c><00:19:26.860><c> unit</c>

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.100 align:start position:0%
to show that like okay the unit
 

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
to show that like okay the unit
economics<00:19:27.279><c> of</c><00:19:27.760><c> this</c><00:19:27.880><c> like</c><00:19:28.090><c> shared</c><00:19:28.590><c> retail</c>

new model and we had like revenue and it
 

00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.180 align:start position:0%
new model and we had like revenue and it
was<00:27:52.890><c> like</c><00:27:53.640><c> it</c><00:27:54.300><c> was</c><00:27:54.450><c> yes</c><00:27:55.410><c> we</c><00:27:55.620><c> had</c><00:27:55.710><c> just</c><00:27:55.800><c> pivoted</c>

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.190 align:start position:0%
was like it was yes we had just pivoted
 

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
was like it was yes we had just pivoted
but<00:27:56.309><c> we</c><00:27:56.400><c> had</c><00:27:56.820><c> done</c><00:27:56.940><c> a</c><00:27:56.970><c> lot</c><00:27:57.240><c> in</c><00:27:57.450><c> a</c><00:27:57.510><c> short</c><00:27:57.540><c> period</c>

00:27:57.919 --> 00:27:57.929 align:start position:0%
but we had done a lot in a short period
 

00:27:57.929 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
but we had done a lot in a short period
of<00:27:58.080><c> time</c><00:27:58.140><c> and</c><00:27:59.010><c> then</c><00:27:59.130><c> I</c><00:27:59.160><c> think</c><00:27:59.400><c> the</c><00:27:59.490><c> third</c><00:27:59.760><c> time</c>

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.090 align:start position:0%
of time and then I think the third time
 

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:03.110 align:start position:0%
of time and then I think the third time
the<00:28:00.450><c> big</c><00:28:00.720><c> difference</c><00:28:01.170><c> was</c><00:28:01.650><c> we</c><00:28:02.429><c> had</c><00:28:02.850><c> a</c><00:28:02.880><c> ton</c><00:28:03.090><c> of</c>

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
the big difference was we had a ton of
 

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.340 align:start position:0%
the big difference was we had a ton of
traction<00:28:03.390><c> we've</c><00:28:03.750><c> been</c><00:28:03.870><c> working</c><00:28:04.140><c> on</c><00:28:04.230><c> it</c><00:28:04.320><c> for</c>

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:04.350 align:start position:0%
traction we've been working on it for
 

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.860 align:start position:0%

over<00:28:04.650><c> a</c><00:28:04.679><c> year</c><00:28:04.770><c> and</c><00:28:05.309><c> I</c><00:28:05.730><c> think</c><00:28:05.790><c> we</c><00:28:06.090><c> were</c><00:28:06.330><c> finally</c>

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:06.870 align:start position:0%
over a year and I think we were finally
 

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.690 align:start position:0%
over a year and I think we were finally
able<00:28:07.140><c> to</c><00:28:07.290><c> make</c><00:28:07.470><c> the</c><00:28:07.559><c> argument</c><00:28:07.980><c> that</c><00:28:08.040><c> like</c><00:28:08.280><c> this</c>

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
able to make the argument that like this
 

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.930 align:start position:0%
able to make the argument that like this
is<00:28:08.910><c> very</c><00:28:09.300><c> scalable</c><00:28:10.220><c> and</c><00:28:11.220><c> then</c><00:28:11.370><c> for</c><00:28:11.790><c> the</c>

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
is very scalable and then for the
 

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.900 align:start position:0%
is very scalable and then for the

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
that stage like we were really able to
 

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.660 align:start position:0%
that stage like we were really able to
explain<00:28:33.809><c> why</c><00:28:34.290><c> we</c><00:28:34.559><c> like</c><00:28:34.800><c> weren't</c><00:28:35.250><c> really</c><00:28:35.520><c> at</c>

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.250 align:start position:0%
explain why we like weren't really at
the<00:28:35.820><c> stage</c><00:28:36.030><c> just</c><00:28:36.300><c> yet</c><00:28:36.570><c> where</c><00:28:36.720><c> we</c><00:28:36.750><c> needed</c><00:28:37.050><c> it</c>

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
the stage just yet where we needed it
 

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.410 align:start position:0%
the stage just yet where we needed it
and<00:28:37.500><c> I</c><00:28:37.830><c> think</c><00:28:38.130><c> we</c><00:28:38.340><c> were</c><00:28:38.490><c> approaching</c><00:28:39.059><c> the</c>

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I think we were approaching the
 

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.930 align:start position:0%
and I think we were approaching the
stage<00:28:39.660><c> where</c><00:28:39.900><c> we</c><00:28:39.929><c> were</c><00:28:40.080><c> going</c><00:28:40.260><c> to</c><00:28:40.440><c> need</c><00:28:40.590><c> it</c><00:28:40.940><c> and</c>

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
stage where we were going to need it and
 

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.790 align:start position:0%
stage where we were going to need it and
now<00:28:42.390><c> we</c><00:28:42.450><c> have</c><00:28:42.540><c> a</c><00:28:42.630><c> bunch</c><00:28:42.750><c> of</c><00:28:42.900><c> remote</c><00:28:43.320><c> developers</c>

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
now we have a bunch of remote developers
 

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.340 align:start position:0%
now we have a bunch of remote developers
that<00:28:43.920><c> are</c><00:28:44.390><c> holding</c><00:28:45.390><c> everything</c><00:28:45.660><c> for</c><00:28:45.960><c> us</c><00:28:46.020><c> but</c>

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:21.500 align:start position:0%
like we really like the store to feel
 

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:23.110 align:start position:0%
like we really like the store to feel

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
like this you know in-person experience
 

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.850 align:start position:0%
like this you know in-person experience

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:24.860 align:start position:0%
and it's not about like kind of going
 

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.230 align:start position:0%
and it's not about like kind of going

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:31.250 align:start position:0%
so I don't necessarily know that be
 

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.510 align:start position:0%
so I don't necessarily know that be

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.670 align:start position:0%
