you all had to agree on the decision to
move<00:24:47.220><c> forward</c><00:24:47.400><c> yeah</c><00:24:47.640><c> for</c><00:24:47.880><c> like</c><00:24:48.000><c> any</c><00:24:48.240><c> decision</c>

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
move forward yeah for like any decision
 

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.409 align:start position:0%
move forward yeah for like any decision
um<00:24:49.320><c> so</c><00:24:49.980><c> I</c><00:24:50.280><c> don't</c><00:24:50.340><c> think</c><00:24:50.460><c> I</c><00:24:50.580><c> need</c><00:24:50.880><c> to</c><00:24:51.000><c> go</c><00:24:51.120><c> into</c><00:24:51.299><c> it</c>

00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think I need to go into it
 

00:24:51.419 --> 00:24:52.789 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think I need to go into it

00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
with this group on my why that's a bad
 

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:53.930 align:start position:0%
with this group on my why that's a bad

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
the fact that we had no type no titles
 

00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.870 align:start position:0%
the fact that we had no type no titles
was<00:24:58.799><c> a</c><00:24:59.039><c> little</c><00:24:59.100><c> bit</c><00:24:59.220><c> of</c><00:24:59.280><c> a</c><00:24:59.460><c> yellow</c><00:24:59.580><c> flag</c>

00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of a yellow flag
 

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.669 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of a yellow flag
because<00:25:00.179><c> it</c><00:25:00.360><c> was</c><00:25:00.480><c> an</c><00:25:00.600><c> early</c><00:25:00.780><c> indicator</c><00:25:01.260><c> that</c>

00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
because it was an early indicator that
 

00:25:01.679 --> 00:25:03.230 align:start position:0%
because it was an early indicator that

the team couldn't have hard
 

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
the team couldn't have hard

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%

00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
decisions when there was disagreement
 

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:09.710 align:start position:0%
decisions when there was disagreement

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
consensus was ultimately disastrous like
 

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.810 align:start position:0%

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
we would just spin we would get stuck in

we would just spin we would get stuck in

um<00:25:19.320><c> so</c><00:25:19.620><c> let's</c><00:25:19.860><c> talk</c><00:25:20.100><c> about</c><00:25:20.220><c> some</c><00:25:20.460><c> ways</c><00:25:20.700><c> to</c>

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
um so let's talk about some ways to
 

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.010 align:start position:0%
um so let's talk about some ways to
protect<00:25:21.059><c> against</c><00:25:21.240><c> this</c><00:25:21.480><c> so</c><00:25:21.659><c> you</c><00:25:21.780><c> all</c><00:25:21.900><c> don't</c>

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
protect against this so you all don't
 

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.169 align:start position:0%
protect against this so you all don't
repeat<00:25:22.200><c> my</c><00:25:22.500><c> mistake</c><00:25:22.799><c> yeah</c><00:25:23.280><c> so</c><00:25:23.460><c> as</c><00:25:23.640><c> Divya</c>

00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%

least naming one person the CEO can
 

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.070 align:start position:0%
least naming one person the CEO can

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
certainly help none of this co-ceo stuff
 

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.289 align:start position:0%
certainly help none of this co-ceo stuff
it<00:25:31.440><c> helps</c><00:25:31.679><c> break</c><00:25:31.799><c> ties</c><00:25:32.100><c> and</c><00:25:32.279><c> disagreement</c><00:25:32.760><c> and</c>

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
it helps break ties and disagreement and
 

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:34.909 align:start position:0%
it helps break ties and disagreement and
it's<00:25:33.419><c> also</c><00:25:33.720><c> just</c><00:25:33.840><c> really</c><00:25:34.020><c> good</c><00:25:34.260><c> practice</c><00:25:34.440><c> for</c>

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
it's also just really good practice for
