than that team
 

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
than that team
if<00:19:51.440><c> you're</c><00:19:51.679><c> splitting</c><00:19:52.080><c> your</c><00:19:52.240><c> resources</c><00:19:52.960><c> two</c>

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
if you're splitting your resources two
 

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.909 align:start position:0%
if you're splitting your resources two
ways<00:19:53.440><c> three</c><00:19:53.600><c> ways</c><00:19:53.919><c> four</c><00:19:54.080><c> ways</c><00:19:54.480><c> like</c>

00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
ways three ways four ways like
 

00:19:55.919 --> 00:19:58.230 align:start position:0%
ways three ways four ways like
so<00:19:56.240><c> it's</c><00:19:56.400><c> not</c><00:19:56.640><c> even</c><00:19:56.880><c> a</c><00:19:57.039><c> good</c><00:19:57.280><c> strategy</c><00:19:57.919><c> even</c><00:19:58.160><c> if</c>

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
so it's not even a good strategy even if
 

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.830 align:start position:0%
so it's not even a good strategy even if
