00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
Wikipedia is like folks would create a
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.350 align:start position:0%
Wikipedia is like folks would create a
fake<00:00:58.860><c> Airfield</c><00:00:59.280><c> so</c><00:00:59.520><c> the</c><00:00:59.760><c> planes</c><00:01:00.059><c> came</c><00:01:00.239><c> back</c>
