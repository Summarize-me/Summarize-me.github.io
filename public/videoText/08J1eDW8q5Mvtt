just trust me there's a brick wall and
 

00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:37.149 align:start position:0%
just trust me there's a brick wall and
you're<00:21:36.000><c> going</c><00:21:36.120><c> to</c><00:21:36.279><c> hit</c><00:21:36.559><c> hit</c><00:21:36.720><c> it</c><00:21:36.880><c> and</c><00:21:37.000><c> it's</c>

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
do after you hit that brick wall and uh
 

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.390 align:start position:0%
do after you hit that brick wall and uh
and<00:21:44.679><c> and</c><00:21:44.799><c> it</c><00:21:44.960><c> got</c><00:21:45.120><c> a</c><00:21:45.240><c> lot</c><00:21:45.400><c> of</c><00:21:45.559><c> us</c><00:21:45.760><c> thinking</c>

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
and and it got a lot of us thinking
 

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.269 align:start position:0%
and and it got a lot of us thinking

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
there isn't a lot of stepping in and and
 

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.870 align:start position:0%
there isn't a lot of stepping in and and

00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
aesthetic design and so we did think
 

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:45.870 align:start position:0%
aesthetic design and so we did think
quite<00:25:44.200><c> a</c><00:25:44.320><c> bit</c><00:25:44.559><c> about</c><00:25:45.279><c> uh</c><00:25:45.399><c> what</c><00:25:45.520><c> we</c><00:25:45.640><c> wanted</c>

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
quite a bit about uh what we wanted
 

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.070 align:start position:0%
quite a bit about uh what we wanted

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
in the room and how that would be
 

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.269 align:start position:0%

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
different from Amazon and so uh um so
 

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:52.389 align:start position:0%
different from Amazon and so uh um so
they<00:25:51.440><c> they're</c><00:25:51.559><c> nuance</c><00:25:51.960><c> and</c><00:25:52.039><c> it's</c><00:25:52.159><c> probably</c>

00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
they they're nuance and it's probably
 

00:25:52.399 --> 00:25:53.870 align:start position:0%
they they're nuance and it's probably

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
the company that's a mechanism and I've
 

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.029 align:start position:0%
the company that's a mechanism and I've
seen<00:27:05.600><c> those</c><00:27:05.880><c> executed</c><00:27:06.399><c> really</c><00:27:06.640><c> really</c><00:27:06.840><c> well</c>

00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%

00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
and I've seen them horrible and so I I
 

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
and I've seen them horrible and so I I

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
um I'd say thoughtfully stubborn which
 

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
um I'd say thoughtfully stubborn which

what I probably the the biggest I could
 

00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:30.549 align:start position:0%
what I probably the the biggest I could
give<00:27:28.279><c> is</c><00:27:28.799><c> spend</c><00:27:29.080><c> a</c><00:27:29.279><c> lot</c><00:27:29.440><c> of</c><00:27:29.679><c> time</c><00:27:30.200><c> about</c><00:27:30.440><c> what</c>

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%

the values and principles are because

the values and principles are because
