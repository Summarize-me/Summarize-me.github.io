the struggle for interestingness but I
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
the struggle for interestingness but I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
too there is no box there and I think
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.660 align:start position:0%
too there is no box there and I think
what<00:01:34.320><c> we</c><00:01:34.409><c> were</c><00:01:34.500><c> trying</c><00:01:34.650><c> to</c><00:01:34.799><c> do</c><00:01:34.920><c> with</c><00:01:35.100><c> beam</c><00:01:35.340><c> like</c>

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to do with beam like
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.859 align:start position:0%
