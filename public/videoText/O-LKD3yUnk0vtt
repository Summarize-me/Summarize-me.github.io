00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
mind helping for those people who might
yeah<00:24:11.860><c> what</c><00:24:12.340><c> is</c><00:24:12.429><c> the</c><00:24:12.580><c> difference</c><00:24:12.970><c> between</c><00:24:13.030><c> like</c>

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:13.450 align:start position:0%
yeah what is the difference between like
 

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.409 align:start position:0%
yeah what is the difference between like
an<00:24:13.540><c> RSU</c><00:24:13.990><c> and</c><00:24:14.169><c> yeah</c><00:24:14.350><c> option</c><00:24:14.860><c> absolutely</c><00:24:15.520><c> so</c><00:24:16.150><c> one</c>

00:24:16.409 --> 00:24:16.419 align:start position:0%
an RSU and yeah option absolutely so one
 

00:24:16.419 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
an RSU and yeah option absolutely so one
of<00:24:16.450><c> the</c><00:24:16.570><c> things</c><00:24:16.720><c> Connelly</c><00:24:16.990><c> misunderstood</c><00:24:17.530><c> is</c>

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:17.590 align:start position:0%
of the things Connelly misunderstood is
 

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the things Connelly misunderstood is
like<00:24:17.710><c> equity</c><00:24:18.070><c> compensation</c>

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:19.850 align:start position:0%
like equity compensation
 

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.030 align:start position:0%
like equity compensation
so<00:24:20.210><c> RS</c><00:24:20.780><c> use</c><00:24:21.080><c> and</c><00:24:21.320><c> options</c><00:24:21.680><c> they're</c><00:24:21.860><c> both</c>

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
so RS use and options they're both
 

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.730 align:start position:0%
so RS use and options they're both
different<00:24:22.340><c> forms</c><00:24:22.880><c> of</c><00:24:23.000><c> equity</c><00:24:23.810><c> that</c><00:24:24.380><c> company</c>

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:24.740 align:start position:0%
different forms of equity that company
 

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.830 align:start position:0%

can offer you in a company the main
 

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
can offer you in a company the main

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:28.730 align:start position:0%
difference that we see options
 

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.540 align:start position:0%

there's a strike prices associated for
 

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
there's a strike prices associated for

00:34:32.899 --> 00:34:32.909 align:start position:0%
integration and then sort of make it
 

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:34.070 align:start position:0%
integration and then sort of make it
work<00:34:33.060><c> and</c><00:34:33.270><c> so</c><00:34:33.330><c> I'm</c><00:34:33.480><c> just</c><00:34:33.510><c> kind</c><00:34:33.810><c> of</c><00:34:33.899><c> curious</c>
