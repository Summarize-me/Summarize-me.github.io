I you know we the the very first thing
 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.490 align:start position:0%
I you know we the the very first thing
that<00:04:18.709><c> I</c><00:04:18.859><c> built</c><00:04:19.130><c> with</c><00:04:19.340><c> an</c><00:04:19.700><c> aunt</c><00:04:19.880><c> who's</c><00:04:20.000><c> our</c><00:04:20.120><c> CTO</c>

was<00:04:21.500><c> actually</c><00:04:21.829><c> a</c><00:04:21.889><c> body</c><00:04:22.130><c> scanner</c><00:04:22.490><c> and</c><00:04:23.480><c> so</c><00:04:23.720><c> so</c><00:04:24.050><c> we</c>

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 align:start position:0%
was actually a body scanner and so so we
 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.530 align:start position:0%
was actually a body scanner and so so we
use<00:04:24.350><c> the</c><00:04:24.590><c> you</c><00:04:24.950><c> know</c><00:04:25.040><c> three</c><00:04:25.820><c> Kinect</c><00:04:26.150><c> sensors</c>

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 align:start position:0%
use the you know three Kinect sensors
 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.510 align:start position:0%
use the you know three Kinect sensors
because<00:04:27.080><c> it's</c><00:04:27.169><c> like</c><00:04:27.260><c> a</c><00:04:27.350><c> depth</c><00:04:27.620><c> sensor</c><00:04:27.740><c> webcam</c>

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
because it's like a depth sensor webcam
 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.250 align:start position:0%
because it's like a depth sensor webcam

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
body form and we thought that we could
 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.010 align:start position:0%
body form and we thought that we could
use<00:04:33.139><c> math</c><00:04:33.380><c> to</c><00:04:33.410><c> shave</c><00:04:33.800><c> away</c><00:04:33.950><c> clothes</c><00:04:34.370><c> and</c><00:04:35.300><c> you</c>

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 align:start position:0%
use math to shave away clothes and you
 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.590 align:start position:0%
use math to shave away clothes and you
know<00:04:36.050><c> use</c><00:04:36.889><c> that</c><00:04:37.070><c> body</c><00:04:37.250><c> form</c><00:04:37.610><c> to</c><00:04:37.730><c> inform</c><00:04:38.419><c> like</c>

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
know use that body form to inform like
 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
know use that body form to inform like
sizing<00:04:39.080><c> decisions</c><00:04:39.500><c> on</c><00:04:39.710><c> internet</c><00:04:40.250><c> yep</c><00:04:40.550><c> right</c>

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 align:start position:0%
sizing decisions on internet yep right
 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:0%

so super creepy thing you know you know
and<00:04:44.270><c> I</c><00:04:44.330><c> think</c><00:04:44.540><c> if</c><00:04:44.750><c> we</c><00:04:44.870><c> had</c><00:04:45.070><c> made</c><00:04:46.070><c> a</c><00:04:46.100><c> couple</c><00:04:46.460><c> of</c>

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 align:start position:0%
and I think if we had made a couple of
 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.909 align:start position:0%
and I think if we had made a couple of

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.650 align:start position:0%

off<00:04:49.160><c> to</c><00:04:49.370><c> do</c><00:04:49.490><c> this</c><00:04:49.639><c> thing</c><00:04:49.910><c> like</c><00:04:49.940><c> why</c><00:04:50.540><c> aren't</c>

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 align:start position:0%
off to do this thing like why aren't
 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.969 align:start position:0%
off to do this thing like why aren't

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
yet with a more competitive market right
yeah<00:10:33.860><c> so</c><00:10:34.130><c> I</c><00:10:34.460><c> mean</c><00:10:34.640><c> what</c><00:10:35.000><c> really</c><00:10:35.030><c> got</c><00:10:35.600><c> what</c>

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:35.930 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean what really got what
 

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.150 align:start position:0%
yeah so I mean what really got what
convinced<00:10:36.380><c> you</c><00:10:36.470><c> that</c><00:10:36.500><c> this</c><00:10:36.800><c> could</c><00:10:36.980><c> work</c>

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
convinced you that this could work
 

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
convinced you that this could work
yeah<00:10:37.430><c> so</c><00:10:37.670><c> so</c><00:10:37.940><c> I</c><00:10:37.970><c> think</c><00:10:38.090><c> what</c><00:10:38.330><c> we</c><00:10:38.420><c> wanted</c><00:10:38.720><c> to</c>

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:38.810 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I think what we wanted to
 

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.660 align:start position:0%
yeah so so I think what we wanted to
prove<00:10:39.230><c> was</c><00:10:39.500><c> that</c><00:10:39.650><c> the</c><00:10:39.740><c> pipe</c><00:10:39.980><c> was</c><00:10:40.190><c> big</c><00:10:40.430><c> enough</c>

which<00:13:42.040><c> is</c><00:13:42.220><c> I</c><00:13:42.670><c> think</c><00:13:43.450><c> enough</c><00:13:44.100><c> to</c><00:13:45.100><c> show</c><00:13:45.310><c> that</c><00:13:45.340><c> you</c>

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:45.850 align:start position:0%
which is I think enough to show that you
 

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.250 align:start position:0%
which is I think enough to show that you
know<00:13:45.940><c> we</c><00:13:46.150><c> could</c><00:13:46.270><c> de-risk</c><00:13:46.690><c> ourselves</c><00:13:47.080><c> from</c><00:13:47.200><c> an</c>

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:47.260 align:start position:0%
know we could de-risk ourselves from an
 

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
know we could de-risk ourselves from an
execution<00:13:47.530><c> perspective</c><00:13:48.370><c> because</c><00:13:48.490><c> that's</c><00:13:48.670><c> a</c>

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:48.730 align:start position:0%
execution perspective because that's a
 

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
execution perspective because that's a
non-trivial<00:13:49.060><c> thing</c><00:13:49.420><c> to</c><00:13:49.690><c> do</c>

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:50.890 align:start position:0%
non-trivial thing to do
 

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
non-trivial thing to do
and<00:13:51.190><c> so</c><00:13:51.340><c> I</c><00:13:51.400><c> know</c><00:13:51.580><c> how</c><00:13:51.760><c> much</c><00:13:51.910><c> did</c><00:13:52.150><c> you</c><00:13:52.240><c> have</c><00:13:52.390><c> to</c>

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:52.510 align:start position:0%
and so I know how much did you have to
 

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.270 align:start position:0%
and so I know how much did you have to
raise<00:13:52.690><c> to</c><00:13:52.930><c> accomplish</c><00:13:53.320><c> that</c><00:13:53.470><c> so</c><00:13:53.650><c> that</c><00:13:53.800><c> was</c><00:13:53.920><c> YC</c>

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
raise to accomplish that so that was YC
 

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.790 align:start position:0%

00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:58.930 align:start position:0%
winter 2017 you were in that position
 

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
winter 2017 you were in that position
Yeah<00:13:59.500><c> right</c><00:13:59.620><c> and</c><00:13:59.950><c> so</c><00:14:00.040><c> we</c><00:14:00.880><c> raised</c><00:14:01.120><c> I</c><00:14:01.330><c> mean</c><00:14:01.480><c> we</c>

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:01.570 align:start position:0%
Yeah right and so we raised I mean we
 

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.250 align:start position:0%
Yeah right and so we raised I mean we
raised<00:14:01.750><c> 3.2</c><00:14:02.530><c> million</c><00:14:02.860><c> bucks</c><00:14:03.250><c> and</c><00:14:03.580><c> I</c><00:14:04.260><c> so</c>

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:05.260 align:start position:0%
raised 3.2 million bucks and I so
 

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
raised 3.2 million bucks and I so
slightly<00:14:06.160><c> some</c><00:14:06.430><c> of</c><00:14:06.550><c> it</c><00:14:06.670><c> before</c><00:14:07.000><c> demo</c><00:14:07.210><c> day</c><00:14:07.360><c> a</c>

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:07.630 align:start position:0%
slightly some of it before demo day a
 

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.630 align:start position:0%
slightly some of it before demo day a
lot<00:14:08.110><c> of</c><00:14:08.140><c> it</c><00:14:08.260><c> after</c><00:14:08.500><c> Deming</c><00:14:08.860><c> huh</c>

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
lot of it after Deming huh
 

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.430 align:start position:0%
lot of it after Deming huh
we<00:14:10.180><c> actually</c><00:14:10.390><c> had</c><00:14:10.660><c> most</c><00:14:10.900><c> of</c><00:14:11.110><c> our</c><00:14:11.200><c> seed</c><00:14:11.410><c> round</c>

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
we actually had most of our seed round
 

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.610 align:start position:0%
we actually had most of our seed round
still<00:14:12.330><c> when</c><00:14:13.330><c> we</c><00:14:13.390><c> raised</c><00:14:13.540><c> hooray</c>

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:14.620 align:start position:0%
still when we raised hooray
 

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.070 align:start position:0%
still when we raised hooray
and<00:14:14.950><c> so</c><00:14:15.100><c> a</c><00:14:15.130><c> big</c><00:14:15.880><c> part</c><00:14:15.910><c> of</c><00:14:16.180><c> it</c><00:14:16.300><c> was</c><00:14:16.450><c> we</c><00:14:16.810><c> knew</c><00:14:16.960><c> that</c>

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
and so a big part of it was we knew that
 

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.150 align:start position:0%
and so a big part of it was we knew that
there<00:14:17.200><c> would</c><00:14:17.320><c> be</c><00:14:17.350><c> there</c><00:14:17.650><c> was</c><00:14:17.800><c> going</c><00:14:17.980><c> to</c><00:14:18.040><c> be</c><00:14:18.130><c> a</c>

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
there would be there was going to be a
 

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
there would be there was going to be a
ramp<00:14:18.430><c> so</c><00:14:19.240><c> we</c><00:14:19.330><c> didn't</c><00:14:19.540><c> make</c><00:14:19.630><c> our</c><00:14:19.780><c> first</c><00:14:19.960><c> hire</c>

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.290 align:start position:0%
ramp so we didn't make our first hire
 

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.230 align:start position:0%
ramp so we didn't make our first hire
for<00:14:21.040><c> probably</c><00:14:21.400><c> the</c><00:14:21.520><c> first</c><00:14:21.700><c> year</c><00:14:21.970><c> and</c><00:14:22.030><c> a</c><00:14:22.090><c> half</c>

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
for probably the first year and a half
 

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
for probably the first year and a half
right<00:14:22.960><c> we</c><00:14:23.590><c> knew</c><00:14:23.710><c> that</c><00:14:23.800><c> it</c><00:14:23.920><c> would</c><00:14:24.010><c> take</c><00:14:24.130><c> a</c>

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:24.190 align:start position:0%
right we knew that it would take a
 

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.650 align:start position:0%
right we knew that it would take a
little<00:14:24.340><c> bit</c><00:14:24.490><c> of</c><00:14:24.640><c> time</c><00:14:24.790><c> to</c><00:14:24.910><c> get</c><00:14:25.030><c> everything</c><00:14:25.330><c> to</c>

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:25.660 align:start position:0%
little bit of time to get everything to
 

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.350 align:start position:0%
little bit of time to get everything to
before<00:14:26.080><c> we</c><00:14:26.140><c> could</c><00:14:26.260><c> start</c><00:14:26.440><c> to</c><00:14:26.560><c> scale</c><00:14:27.180><c> but</c><00:14:28.180><c> yeah</c>

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
before we could start to scale but yeah

as<00:33:40.780><c> well</c><00:33:40.960><c> and</c><00:33:41.920><c> so</c><00:33:42.070><c> we</c><00:33:42.160><c> kind</c><00:33:42.340><c> of</c><00:33:42.370><c> just</c><00:33:42.490><c> kept</c><00:33:42.730><c> our</c>

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
as well and so we kind of just kept our
 

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
as well and so we kind of just kept our
heads<00:33:43.059><c> down</c><00:33:43.300><c> all</c><00:33:44.170><c> the</c><00:33:44.350><c> lessons</c><00:33:44.650><c> we</c><00:33:44.740><c> learned</c>

from the first time around were compost
mm-hm<00:33:47.080><c> and</c><00:33:47.770><c> so</c><00:33:48.010><c> we</c><00:33:48.640><c> could</c><00:33:48.820><c> we</c><00:33:49.030><c> have</c><00:33:49.179><c> two</c><00:33:49.210><c> pretty</c>

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:50.050 align:start position:0%
mm-hm and so we could we have two pretty
 

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
mm-hm and so we could we have two pretty
good<00:33:50.170><c> cadence</c><00:33:50.530><c> of</c><00:33:50.740><c> just</c><00:33:50.920><c> making</c><00:33:51.130><c> sure</c><00:33:51.400><c> we're</c>
