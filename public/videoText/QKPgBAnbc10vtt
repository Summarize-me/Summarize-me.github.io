we can ride the software from scratch
 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.950 align:start position:0%
we can ride the software from scratch
and<00:05:28.039><c> then</c><00:05:28.160><c> the</c><00:05:28.280><c> bank</c><00:05:28.479><c> would</c><00:05:28.639><c> work</c><00:05:28.880><c> better</c><00:05:29.840><c> and</c>

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
and then the bank would work better and
 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.029 align:start position:0%
and then the bank would work better and
it<00:05:30.039><c> turns</c><00:05:30.280><c> out</c><00:05:30.479><c> that's</c><00:05:30.720><c> true</c><00:05:31.520><c> it's</c><00:05:32.039><c> miraculous</c>

it turns out that's true it's miraculous

is<00:05:35.759><c> we</c><00:05:35.960><c> launched</c><00:05:36.440><c> a</c><00:05:36.720><c> prototype</c><00:05:37.440><c> really</c><00:05:37.840><c> really</c>
