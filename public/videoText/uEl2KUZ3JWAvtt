00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 align:start position:0%
I have a rough outline with a few
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.370 align:start position:0%
I have a rough outline with a few
general<00:00:33.180><c> topics</c><00:00:33.690><c> that</c><00:00:33.870><c> you</c><00:00:33.960><c> seem</c><00:00:34.260><c> to</c><00:00:34.290><c> have</c>

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
general topics that you seem to have
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260 align:start position:0%
general topics that you seem to have
written<00:00:34.590><c> about</c><00:00:34.770><c> a</c><00:00:34.829><c> few</c><00:00:35.010><c> times</c><00:00:35.130><c> and</c><00:00:35.489><c> I</c><00:00:36.030><c> figure</c>

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 align:start position:0%
written about a few times and I figure
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
written about a few times and I figure
we<00:00:36.390><c> can</c><00:00:36.510><c> kind</c><00:00:36.719><c> of</c><00:00:36.750><c> just</c><00:00:36.899><c> go</c><00:00:37.079><c> into</c><00:00:37.320><c> each</c><00:00:37.469><c> one</c><00:00:38.210><c> so</c>

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 align:start position:0%
we can kind of just go into each one so
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.750 align:start position:0%
we can kind of just go into each one so
it<00:00:40.170><c> seems</c><00:00:40.559><c> like</c><00:00:40.800><c> there</c><00:00:41.309><c> are</c><00:00:41.340><c> several</c>

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
it seems like there are several
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.150 align:start position:0%
it seems like there are several

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.410 align:start position:0%
is hard but I think like making check-in
to<00:03:05.340><c> make</c><00:03:05.370><c> sure</c><00:03:05.520><c> you're</c><00:03:05.790><c> working</c><00:03:05.970><c> on</c><00:03:06.210><c> things</c>

it or is it going well do we need to
 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.970 align:start position:0%
it or is it going well do we need to

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
usually you it's the constant the crowd
is<00:08:59.650><c> right</c><00:08:59.800><c> sometimes</c><00:09:00.420><c> and</c><00:09:02.100><c> okay</c><00:09:03.100><c> fine</c><00:09:03.400><c> but</c>

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:03.970 align:start position:0%
is right sometimes and okay fine but
 

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.510 align:start position:0%
is right sometimes and okay fine but

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
then how do you become decisive because
 

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
then how do you become decisive because
you<00:09:06.910><c> say</c><00:09:07.120><c> a</c><00:09:07.150><c> year</c><00:09:07.420><c> so</c><00:09:07.690><c> this</c><00:09:07.840><c> is</c><00:09:07.960><c> the</c><00:09:08.080><c> trend</c>

00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
risk explanation so specifically you say
 

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
risk explanation so specifically you say
things<00:15:58.510><c> in</c><00:15:58.630><c> life</c><00:15:58.779><c> are</c><00:15:58.990><c> rarely</c><00:15:59.019><c> as</c><00:15:59.470><c> risky</c><00:15:59.920><c> as</c>

00:15:59.940 --> 00:15:59.950 align:start position:0%
things in life are rarely as risky as
 

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:01.650 align:start position:0%
things in life are rarely as risky as
they<00:16:00.339><c> seem</c><00:16:00.610><c> most</c><00:16:01.000><c> people</c><00:16:01.300><c> are</c><00:16:01.450><c> too</c>

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:01.660 align:start position:0%
they seem most people are too
 

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.230 align:start position:0%
they seem most people are too
risk-averse<00:16:02.200><c> and</c><00:16:02.410><c> so</c><00:16:02.860><c> most</c><00:16:03.130><c> advice</c><00:16:03.459><c> is</c><00:16:03.700><c> biased</c>

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
risk-averse and so most advice is biased
 

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.870 align:start position:0%
risk-averse and so most advice is biased
too<00:16:04.480><c> much</c><00:16:04.660><c> towards</c><00:16:05.140><c> conservative</c><00:16:05.769><c> paths</c><00:16:05.980><c> yeah</c>

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
too much towards conservative paths yeah
 

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.310 align:start position:0%
too much towards conservative paths yeah
I<00:16:06.910><c> mean</c><00:16:07.029><c> the</c><00:16:07.149><c> risk</c><00:16:07.300><c> is</c><00:16:07.510><c> you</c><00:16:07.540><c> look</c><00:16:07.779><c> that</c><00:16:08.079><c> they're</c>

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
I mean the risk is you look that they're
 

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.110 align:start position:0%
I mean the risk is you look that they're
real<00:16:08.560><c> what</c><00:16:08.860><c> risk</c><00:16:09.070><c> actually</c><00:16:09.579><c> looks</c><00:16:09.790><c> like</c><00:16:09.940><c> is</c>

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
real what risk actually looks like is
 

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
real what risk actually looks like is
that<00:16:10.149><c> you</c><00:16:10.390><c> look</c><00:16:10.570><c> back</c><00:16:10.750><c> at</c><00:16:10.930><c> the</c><00:16:11.019><c> end</c><00:16:11.050><c> of</c><00:16:11.260><c> your</c>

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:55.540 align:start position:0%
do one is you take a lot of random
 

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.450 align:start position:0%
do one is you take a lot of random

00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
time you will waste your time and be
 

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.540 align:start position:0%

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.650 align:start position:0%
painful and sometimes it's so valuable I
think<00:25:27.160><c> if</c><00:25:27.370><c> you</c><00:25:27.460><c> cut</c><00:25:27.640><c> it</c><00:25:27.730><c> off</c><00:25:27.820><c> entirely</c><00:25:28.390><c> its</c>

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:28.660 align:start position:0%
think if you cut it off entirely its
 

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.570 align:start position:0%
think if you cut it off entirely its
disastrous<00:25:29.140><c> like</c><00:25:29.500><c> if</c><00:25:29.800><c> you</c><00:25:30.010><c> don't</c><00:25:30.100><c> have</c><00:25:30.280><c> any</c>
